# Tomango 2018

First of all, install Hugo if you haven't already with: `brew install hugo`.

Then `npm install` and run `npm run serve` to load the site on `http://localhost:1313`.

Run `npm start` in another terminal tab if you want to live compile SCSS/JS. It's not ideal, but `hugo-bin` was so slow copying static files and I haven't had a chance to work out why.
