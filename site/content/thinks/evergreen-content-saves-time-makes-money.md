I'm going to let you in on a little secret that will help your [online marketing](/creates/online-marketing/) campaign be successful AND save you time into the bargain.

I'm going to tell you all about Evergreen Content.

## What is evergreen content?

So what is this magical ingredient that makes your content marketing campaign so successful?

Well it's nothing to do with trees, and it's nothing to do with colours. Evergreen content refers to an article (usually a blog post) that doesn't age or date quickly, or at least isn't short-lived; it stays relevant for a long time - it stays "evergreen".

*Here's an example to demonstrate;*

A blog on "How to plan a website project" will stay relevant for a very long time, because although technology and design trends in websites change from year to year, the principles you follow when planning your project have pretty much stayed the same for the last 10 years. This content is Evergreen.

However, a topic "Website design trends for 2015" has a very definite - and relatively short - shelf-life, and will become out of date quite quickly. Even by Spring 2015 this article would seem dated. This content is not Evergreen.

## Why you should care about evergreen content

You should care about having evergreen content on your website for one very good reason. People will look for this content again and again and again - driving traffic to your website month after month without you having to do anything.

Just take a look at this graphic. It shows the number of visitors that have landed on our most popular blog post, "[How to create a brand design brief](/thinks/how-to-create-a-brand-design-brief)" over the last two years. The post was published on 4th January 2013.

As you can see, the post generates between 150-200 visits every month. Let me just repeat - that's EVERY MONTH.

And here's a similar graphic showing the number of visits to our second most popular post, called "[Branding and rebranding - how to roll out a new brand identity](/thinks/branding-and-rebranding-how-to-roll-out-a-new-brand-identity)". This post was published on 21st June 2013. You can see where it was published and started receiving visitors on the graph.

![](images/blog/google-analytics-branding-and-rebranding-719x391.jpg "Our second most popular blog post receives on average around 100 visitors each and every month")

This post generates around 100 visits each and every month.

These numbers on their own might not seem very big, but see what happens when you extrapolate that out. If over the course of a year you write just one great piece of evergreen content each month that generates 100 visitors a month to your site, at the end of year one, you're getting *1,200 visitors to your site each month, every month*. Publish a post a week, and that number goes up to *5,200 visitors*.

## Benefit 1: Evergreen content saves you time

Producing great quality evergreen content is a very wise investment of your precious time. As you can see from the examples above, once published, these posts attract good volumes of visitors on an ongoing basis, building up a foundation of web traffic to your site.

That eases the pressure on the person managing your blog (and that may well be you) to keep writing relevant, high-quality content every week. Sure, you can go faster if you want, and build up your traffic more quickly, but it certainly makes life easier. *Evergreen content saves you time*.

## Benefit 2: Evergreen content makes you money

Evergreen content provides you with a constant stream of web traffic long after its been published. A half-decent website should convert around 10% of this traffic into sales enquiries, online sales or email subscribers.

Make sure you always include a clear call to action within your content to capture this traffic and turn it into business.

By following these principles, you'll see how *evergreen content makes you money*.

## Ideas for topics for your Evergreen content

Every business, industry and organisation will have topics that can provide good topics for Evergreen content. You need to call on your knowledge and experience to come up with the topics that will work for you.

To get your creative juices flowing, ask yourself:

- What questions do your customers always ask?
- What are the "silly questions" that customers want to ask, if only they weren't so shy?
- What underlying principles haven't changed in your field of work, and remain as relevant today as they did years ago?



## Here are a few ideas for topics for your evergreen content:

*"How to..."* articles often make brilliant evergreen content. Users regularly start a search using "How to..." so you have a chance to provide them with a step-by-step guide to a process you're familiar with. This also gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your expertise in your field or industry.

*Definitions* - most industries have common acronyms or use jargon; take advantage of this with posts that explain what they are. This post itself could have been written as a Definition piece by calling it "What is Evergreen content?"

*Resources* - group together lists of useful resources relevant to your field and be sure to present them in a thoughtful and informative way. Great resource lists will often also be shared on social media, increasing the reach of your content even further.

*FAQ* - are there questions you regularly get asked by your customers or prospects? Consider grouping these together under a common theme and give it a suitable title like "5 common questions about..."
