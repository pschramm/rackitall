In all businesses, every so often you need to be prepared to make significant changes to the way you do things.

And sometimes these changes come about quicker than you planned, but still work out for the best.

This was how it worked out at Tomango when we decided to look again at how we can improve the way we deliver projects for our clients.

We recognised that as a creative agency we've moved on in terms of the type of projects we're working on now, and the established way we were doing things wasn't really working any more. We were already starting to adopt a more agile approach, but needed to make sure everyone on the team understood and was fully on-board with the idea.

It meant making changes to everyone's role, and re-evaluating where in the project people needed to be involved.

And then, in addition, there were other factors to take on board;

As you may know, Tomango was formed in January 2013 when directors Julian Wates and Mark Vaesen merged their two businesses. After three successful years, differences were starting to appear in how we wanted to move the business forward, and after much deliberation Julian and his wife (and fellow director) Jude decided to leave Tomango in December 2015 to pursue other opportunities. We all wish them well in their new venture.

In some ways this helped push us towards the new way of working. Because we needed to cover the extra work and responsibilities that were left, the new approach had to happen immediately.

We started the new approach at the end of last year and so far, the results have been very good - beyond our expectations, even. Getting more people involved earlier in the project has produced more cohesive results, and project delivery time has been reduced. And perhaps most importantly, we're all happier with how the feeling we have when a project's finished.

Looking to the future, we're actively recruiting to build the Online Marketing part of the business, which is growing rapidly. We're looking for a talented and driven [Digital Marketing Manager](/careers/) and an ambitious, experienced [Digital Marketing Executive](/careers/) to work with key clients on their online marketing strategy. Do you have what it takes to [join our team](/careers/)?

I guess sometimes you have to work through a bit of pain to achieve something better. I'm certainly very excited about Tomango's future and looking forward to completing more great work using our new approach.
