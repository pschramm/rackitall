The biggest and best companies in the world can spend millions of pounds trying to find that perfect image to represent their brand.

There's thousands of examples out there, but some stand out thanks to small factors behind their design that elevate them from a standard logo to something a bit special.

## 1. Sony Vaio

A perfect example of a logo that has an ingenious element to it, this one for Sony's now-discontinued range of Vaio laptops uses the letter of the brand name to cleverly show the integration of the analogue and digital data transfer. The V and A combine to represent an analogue wave signal, whilst the I and O are reminiscent of the ones and zeros of binary code.

## 2. Amazon

It's one of the ten biggest websites in the world and is home to what Google have labelled 'their biggest competitor in search', thanks to the number of queries customers put into it. You've probably seen Amazon's logo hundreds of times, but have you ever really paid attention to it?

Amazon of course famously started off as an online bookshop, but nowadays sell anything and everything - homeware, electronics, clothes, jewellery, garden tools...the list is endless.

It's therefore quite apt that this is reflected in their logo - they literally sell everything, from A to Z.

## 3. Formula One

Negative space can be an exceptionally effective means of adding to a logo.

At first glance this one from Formula One comprises of a black F and a weird, swooshy red number 1, signifying the incredibly fast speeds the cars travel at...or at least, that's what I thought it was through years of watching the sport!

As it turns out (and when I first saw it, I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it sooner) there's actually a proper number 1 created using the negative space between it! Very smart.

## 4. FedEx

Another prime contender for best use of negative space, and probably the most well-known, is FedEx.

Winner of over 40 design awards and named in the top eight logos of all time by of Rolling Stone, its success lies in the subtle arrow that's made up of the gap between the E and x.

## 5. London Symphony Orchestra

A beautifully designed logo, this one for the London Symphony Orchestra cleverly combines the three letters LSO into a one red flowing line that just so happens to also look like a conductor with a baton in hand.

## 6. Milwaukee Brewers

![](images/blog/milwaukee_brewers_alternate_logo-svg-978x1024.png)

One of baseball's most iconic team logos and crests, this one was the Milwaukee Brewers' official logo from 1978 to 1993 and was selected from an open competition that received over 2000 entries.

The logo combines the lower case letters 'm' and 'b', the club's initials, to form a baseball glove.

## 7. Tour de France

![](images/blog/tour-de-france-logo-1024x873.jpg)

Possibly my favourite one of the entire list. This logo, designed in 2002, contains both a splash of yellow in homage to the famous 'maillot jaune' as well as a brilliant typographical figure of a cyclist.
