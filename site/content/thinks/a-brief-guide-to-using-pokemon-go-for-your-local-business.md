Not heard of Pokemon Go? Where have you been?!

Since its release, the augmented reality-based game has taken the world by absolute storm. It's been a constant trending topic on Twitter for about a week now (yes, even throughout all the political guff going on) and has seen Nintendo's share price rise by a mammoth [86 per cent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pokemon-go-ninetendo-apple-google-share-price-market-value-a7138426.html)!

And, on a worldwide scale, this massive dose of 90's nostalgia is seeing more active daily users than Twitter and WhatsApp, and even more engagement than Facebook.

Pokemon Go has also surpassed Candy Crush as the most popular mobile game in history.

It's tricking people into exercising AND socialising, and brand marketing teams are busy trying to jump on the bandwagon and shoehorn Pokemon tweets into their feeds - as per the following examples:

Or how about US soccer team Vancouver Whitecaps, who used it to help unveil their latest summer signings:

But it seems that the best uses for Pokemon Go as a marketing tool comes courtesy of small businesses, and the best example we've seen so far comes from India courtesy of the [Muncie Animal Shelter](https://www.facebook.com/MuncieAnimalShelter/photos/a.223109177771509.54516.220023711413389/1050999401649145/?type=3&amp;theater).

Part of the game sees players collecting Pokemon eggs that require a certain amount of walking to hatch. Eggs come in the 2km, 5km, and 10km categories - meaning a lot of traipsing around before you see what's inside!

The eggs are one of the key sources of the rarer Pokemon the game has to offer, and has seen some players clocking up miles upon miles as they look to catch 'em all.

What did Muncie Animal Shelter do? Well, they asked Pokemon Go players to swing by and grab one of their many dogs that need walking, and take them along for the journey!

It's a great idea - though how hard it is to multitask the two we don't know...but it's being reported that more than 150 people have turned up to help them out. Not bad at all!

But how can you use it for your local business? Here are three ways you can jump on the Poke-bandwagon and attempt to drive more sales:


### Cater for teams


Pokemon Go sees players split into three teams, each of which are fighting against the other two for control of the thousands of Pokemon Gyms within the game.

Got a gym near your business? Why not offer a discount to members of the team that currently hold it?

There's examples of some cafes using this to good effect, and the fact that the offer is a 'living' one that changes as the game is played makes it more engaging for customers.

Or, if you're an employee who's already allied to a certain team, why not offer teammates discounts...while punishing others!

### Become a charging station

Walking around with your phone constantly out uses a lot of juice.

Why not become a charging station and offer the ability to top up a phone battery while customers are in your establishment? You'll then have them there for as long as it takes them to get to 100 per cent - plenty of time to make a sale or two.

### Use 'lures' to increase footfall

If a Pokemon Go player is finding that the number of Pokemon in their vicinity is pretty sparse, one of the in-game features is the ability to drop what's known as a 'Lure Module'.

When used, these essentially increase the number of Pokemon going through a given area for a 30 minute period. These Lure Modules can either be earned through gameplay or purchased for a nominal fee.

The genius of this is that, for a minimal outlay, you can advertise your shop as a prime hub for collecting Pokemon, thanks to the lures you've dropped.

You can even go one step further and offer discounts to customers who can prove that they've dropped a Lure Module around your business, keeping the whole thing going for longer!

One pizzeria in New York,  [L'inizio's Pizza Bar](http://linizio.com/), is reported to have spent as little as $10 on Lure Modules last weekend and saw a massive 75 per cent increase in business. It's definitely worth considering.

The localised nature of playing Pokemon Go makes it perfect for small businesses, and it's worth investigating to see whether you can jump on the zeitgeist and make it work to your advantage.

It remains to be seen how the makers of the game will look to increase revenue streams from the game besides in-app purchases (there aren't currently any ads running). It could yet bring more opportunities for marketers - think sponsored locations, or paying to have the rarest Pokemon appear in your store - but until then, the above tactics should be enough to get you started.

If you're a small business operating in a local area and think Pokemon Go is one step too far, why not see if Tomango's [local SEO services](/creates/online-marketing/seo/) might be a better fit?
