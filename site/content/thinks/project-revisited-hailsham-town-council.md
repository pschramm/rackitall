In June 2015, Tomango finished a project to design and develop the new [website for Hailsham Town Council](http://www.tomango.co.uk/created/hailsham-town-council/).

Our brief was to design and develop a new website for the council to give residents easy access to council services and information about the town.

The client wanted a website that was accessible to all, and embraced the very essence of good design; something that didn’t just look good, but was easy and intuitive to use, regardless of the device being used or any impairments the user might have.

A little under 18 months since it was launched, we reviewed the impact of the new site with the manager of the project at the council, Communications Officer Terry Hall.

I started by asking him to elaborate on what the council wanted from their new site.

"We wanted a completely different website - one that gave much greater flexibility, and the ability to deliver an ever-increasing amount of information to local residents, businesses and community organisations. Our site carries a lot of information and needs to appeal to the widest target audience, who have varying computer and technical abilities!

Our top priority was to have the website redesigned and developed so every user could access the right information more quickly and easily."

__*"One of the things that struck us very early on in the project was how you and your colleagues really bought in to what makes a good website. How bad was the previous site?"*__

"Well, although the previous website was informative enough, and achieved a high standard of service, we knew we needed a brand new look and a better navigational structure and improved accessibility in order to make it easier to find out about the Council's activities and news items of relevance to the town.

> "It's important we keep apace with the needs of residents"

We welcomed the move to modernise our site because it is important we keep apace with the needs of residents, and recognise what a modern local government should be delivering to its residents."

__*"So, at the end of the project...what did you get?"*__

"Well I think it's fair to say that you guys have definitely been able to produce a completely new design to the specifications we laid out, and within the required timeframe.

The website is fully bespoke in terms of the look and feel and there is no visible evidence of the underlying architecture behind it. It's simple to use, fully responsive - so completely compatible with smart phones and other devices - and accessible to users of all abilities.

The bespoke content management system you built makes it very easy for us to keep the content up-to-date. The process is very simple, intuitive and uncomplicated, and we can now present the Council’s documents – like meeting agendas, reports and minutes – in a way which is much more accessible to our users."

__*"So the new site's actually improved how you keep Hailsham residents updated?"*__

"Yes, it has. The news section on the site is a great tool. Now we are able to provide a much more proactive approach to what's happening in the town, and provide updates on things like the Council’s activities, events and improvements to services in a clearer and more accessible way.

The end result is a unique, easy-to-use and informative website - for both our parishioners and potential visitors to the town."

__*"What feedback have you had from residents?"*__

"The feedback about the look and feel of the site from residents, local businesses and the other community organisations we're involved with has all been positive since the launch of the redesigned site last summer __(June 2015)__.

Residents are making good use of the Committee meetings section to access public documents like agendas, minutes and financial accounts.

Additional feedback has mentioned the new site’s clear layout, with comments about better navigation, improved clarity of information, less clutter, clear signposts with no over-crowding of information and improved accessibility for people with visual impairments."

__*"And finally - how was it working with Tomango; would you say it was a positive experience?"*__

"We always knew we needed to find a web design company we could work well with on this project and we researched the local market thoroughly before appointing you.

Throughout the project, Tomango always made working together easy and painless.

From new requirements popping up to last minute changes, the overall approach has always been positive. Even post-launch, the team has continued to be helpful and interactive, meaning we can solve any issues quickly and resolutely."

We're very appreciative of your creative efforts and absolutely delighted with the new site.”
