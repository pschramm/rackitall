The Rio Olympics is in full swing, so it's only right I put together an Olympic-themed blog!

From swimming pools mysteriously [turning green](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/rio-2016-green-olympic-swimming-diving-pool-water-contaminated-say-experts-a7182276.html) through to the [breaking of a 2,168 year-old record](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/sports/olympics/michael-phelps-200-im-ryan-lochte-leonidas.html), it's already proving to be another fascinating spectacle.

And, notwithstanding the craziness of Rule 40 or the IOC's [banning of GIFs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/05/the-ioc-is-cracking-down-on-olympic-gifs-but-how-effective-can-they-be/), there's also been some [cracking memes](http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/rio-olympics-10-best-memes-from-summer-games-w435367) doing the rounds.

For this list, however, I've chosen to focus on some of the more interesting and in-depth content.

Below is a combination of the best marketing and advertising, visualisations, explanations and celebrations that the media has produced.

All are worth a watch, so enjoy.

## BBC - 'The Greatest Show on Earth'

The Beeb is famous for their incredible adverts and idents for major sporting events and the high production value that they have. Heck, I still occasionally return to the closing montage from the [2014 World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vYnEGIcXVY) for a dose of nostalgia!

For Rio the BBC uses the Brazilian rainforests as a backdrop to trail *'The Greatest Show on Earth'*, and it sees an array of athletic Amazonian animals running, jumping, diving and more in this lovely animation.

## New York Times - 'Why is Simone Biles the World's Best Gymnast?'

Simone Biles was already considered the world's greatest gymnast before she set her sights on Rio.

Aged just 19, her rise to the top of her sport has been remarkably quick; the American has already claimed more World Championship titles than anyone in history, and all have come in the interim since the London Olympics.

She's considered far and away the best on both the floor and the vault, and is hot favourite to win an unprecedented five Olympic gold medals. At the time of writing, Biles has already bagged two.

What makes her so great? To gain some insight, check out the above fascinating profile courtesy of the New York Times.

## New York Times - 'One Race, Ever Medalist Ever'

Strictly speaking, this video came out shortly after the 2012 final of the men's 100 metres...but what kind of Olympic list would it be without a healthy dose of Usain Bolt?

In this clip, the New York Times produce a fascinating piece of visualisation that pits the top three from every final since 1896 against each other.

You know Bolt is fast - but how does his advantage over say, Jesse Owens, translate to a lead on the track?

The [full article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html) comes with a neat bit of interactive on-page visualisation as well, and the NYT also did similar pieces with the 100m freestyle swimming and men's long jump.

## Under Armour - 'Rule Yourself'

{{< youtube Xh9jAD1ofm4 >}}

Michael Phelps is a machine. Four gold medals in Rio to add to four in London, EIGHT in Beijing, and six in Athens. I mean, really.

He's literally built for it. His arm span is inches longer than his height, his lungs are two times the size they should be, his ankles hyper-extend (a.k.a natural flippers!), and he's got a long torso and relatively short legs. It's practically cheating.

Anyway, this summer he featured in the following advert for Under Armour - a company that has been making incredible inroads in recent years through its sports marketing ([it's now second in the USA behind Nike](https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/05/04/how-under-armour-plans-to-become-the-worlds-biggest-sports-brand/)).

The advert, 'Rule Yourself', is dramatic, inspirational, and the second most shared Olympic ad of this games.

## Channel 4 - 'We're the Superhumans'

Doing something that's nigh on impossible and knocking Phelps off the top spot is this incredible TV spot from Channel 4 advertising their coverage of the Paralympics.

In fact, 'We're the Superhumans' is so popular that it's the second most-shared Olympic advert ever!

I'll say no more - watch it now.

## Wall Street Journal - Inside the Floor Routine Once Thought Impossible

It's back to gymnastics for the last video in the list, because it's seriously impressive.

This video from the Wall Street Journal focuses on America's Aly Raisman, the world's second best all-around gymnast and reigning champion in the floor discipline.

Her floor routine contains moves other competitors won't even attempt. She explains: "My first tumbling pass I do a roundoff, one-and-half-stepout, into roundoff, back handspring, arabian double front, punch layout." Err...what?

Whatever it means, she has just over 55 feet of floor to pull it off.

They tumble so bloody fast across that mat this video does a great job of breaking each stage down in slow motion into all its composite flips and twists...which frankly makes it all the more incredible.
