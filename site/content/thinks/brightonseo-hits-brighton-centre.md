Last Friday saw another Brighton SEO conference take place, and I was lucky to once again attend after [my first visit in April](/thinks/brighton-seo-how-to-be-a-local-seo-jedi/).

This time it was held at its new home at the Brighton Centre - a testament to how popular the event has gotten since 2011, and a far cry from the back room of a pub where the first one was held!

Around three thousand search marketers were in attendance to take in a whole host of talks from an array of industry experts, and it once again proved to be a valuable experience.

Here's a rundown of some of my highlights:

## [Stacey MacNaught](https://twitter.com/staceycav?lang=en-gb) - What can white-hat link builders learn from churn and burn spammers?

Starting the day off on the main stage was Stacey MacNaught, Search Director of Tecmark, who gave a great talk on what current link-building efforts can learn from old-school methods.

One of the main points Stacey made was that *quantity *still plays a big part in link-building.

Previously, when search algorithms were more rudimentary, you could get away with 'article spinning' - writing a post, then copying it and changing some of the keywords to synonyms. This meant you could end up with dozens of slightly different copies of the same article that you would then submit to a number of article directories, gaining a ton of links!

This obviously doesn't work any more, and *content marketing *is the recommended way to conduct link-building outreach.

Where the quantity element comes in though, is through the outreach itself. Once you've produced a killer piece of content for a client, you should be spending time 'playing the numbers game' and contacting a solid number of media contacts in anticipation of them placing it on their website with a back-link.

However, Stacey also warned that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, and you should be trying to use other tactics to supplement content marketing.

*Image attribution* can be a powerful means of attaining links (as no-one likes to fall foul of copyright laws) - [full guide here](http://blogsession.co.uk/2016/09/image-link-building-guide/).

Attaining *forward feature* *calendars *from publications relevant to your client's industry can help you produce content that could help ensure is relevant to a feature writer's needs.

And conducting outreach to **freelance regional journalists** can be useful - especially if they also write for nationals (double link possibilities).

Stacey's full presentation is above.

## [Christian Ward](https://twitter.com/wardchristianj) - Why local search is essential for brands and the agencies who serve them

Seeing as how practically all my clients are local SEO clients I attended this session, which wasn't on the main stage but in a rather cramped room on the third floor of the Brighton Centre - standing room only!

Christian works for Yext, an American company that enables businesses to update location-related information on multiple websites from one place.

Correct data and information is critical to ranking well in local SEO, so this talk was useful and helped me build a bit more onto what I learned from my day-long local SEO training session from [the last Brighton SEO](/thinks/brighton-seo-how-to-be-a-local-seo-jedi/).

Anyway, diving in to some of the takeaways from this session - there are *three things* that determine how well a website ranks for a local search:

- *Relevance* - is there a strong correlation between what's being searched and what the business provides;
- *Distance* from where the search is being conducted; and
- *Prominence* - how well received the business is by customers (think Google reviews)


Another point that stood out - just *one per cent* of businesses have [schema markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) on their name, address and telephone number (NAP) on their website!

And finally, consistency of *online citations *is crucial. The more consistent they are and the sooner you get them in order the better; otherwise Google will have a hard time deciding where your company is located, which can have a detrimental effect on how it appears in local search results.

## [Phil Nottingham](https://twitter.com/philnottingham?lang=en-gb) - A strategy for the new wave of video platforms

This presentation dived into the different ways to take advantage of a number of different online video platforms - namely YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Periscope, and Snapchat.

Previously, a video marketing strategy involved chucking all videos on YouTube...and that was that!

Nowadays, however, there's much more to bear in mind. The major social networks are all video platforms in their own right, each with their own differences that need to be kept in mind when creating a tailored video strategy.

For example, *Facebook* videos are automatically played when scrolled past in a news feed - but the audio is muted until clicked. Therefore, the beginning of a video could do with overlaid text to try and grab attention!Another great tip for *YouTube* is to create playlists for keywords you want to try to rank for but you may not have directly created content for.

An example of this that Phil provided was from Jamie Oliver's Drinks Tube channel - a channel that, obviously, has loads of videos of how to make various cocktails etc. Their [Thanksgiving Drinks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlnO2fSQw0mwtYZK3S1HaZG3N_jX8QS6s) playlist cleverly uses this tactic; while none of the drinks themselves specifically Thanksgiving focused, their playlist ranks as one of the top results for that term!

These were just three of the 11 talks I saw in just over 8 hours of Brighton SEO (including a rather long lunch at the local Bill's) - and all for free! You can't knock that one bit!

If you want to see some of these and many other of the talks that took place on the BrightonSEO mainstage, you can check out the recording of the [YouTube livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_tsFduHnpU).

A full-ish list of all the presentation decks are also available [here](http://www.brightonseo.com/presentation-decks-september-2016-brightonseo/).

The next event is scheduled for April - if you haven't been before I heartily recommend trying to snag a ticket and get down there...you won't regret it!
