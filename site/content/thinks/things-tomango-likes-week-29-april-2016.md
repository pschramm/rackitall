After starting strongly a [fortnight ago](/thinks/things-tomango-likes-week-15-april-2016/), this supposedly weekly round-up blog had a week off last Friday as I was attending the awesome [Brighton SEO](http://www.brightonseo.com/) conference. You can read about a lot of the bits I learned on Local SEO [here](/thinks/brighton-seo-how-to-be-a-local-seo-jedi/).

Anyway, here's a quick blast through the week and some of the more interesting things we've noticed this week in the worlds of [Brand](/creates/brand/), [Web](/creates/web/), and [Online Marketing](/creates/online-marketing/).

## BRAND AND DESIGN: Guinness show off updated logo

Everyone's been harping on about this logo this week! Get it?

Anyway...Guinness - one of the world's most famous alcohol brands - unveiled a refreshed logo this week. Sticking with the famous harp that's been on their branding since 1892, the redesign moves against the trend for producing simpler, flatter, more 'digital friendly' designs, instead adding a bit more depth and character.

[Design Bridge](http://www.designbridge.com/), the company responsible for the design, started from scratch rather than looking at previous versions. They reproduced it in a number of printing techniques and mediums to identify the best possible colour set-up for the logo, leading to the wonderful textured look you can see below.

As well as the added detail, the 'Established 1759' has moved within the harp design. Moreover, the font used for the brand name has been slightly adjusted, with the serifs being shortened.

Mark Sandys, Diageo Global Head of Beer and Baileys, said of the design: “In keeping with the Guinness ‘Made of More’ ethos, we have reintroduced a special handmade quality to the harp to reflect the experience, craftsmanship and passion that we put into brewing our Guinness beers.”

I think it's done just the job!

## *SOCIAL MEDIA - #EdBallsDay*

Was it ever going to be anything else?

The fifth anniversary of the eponymous tweet was on Thursday, with the hashtag #EdBallsDay trending from midnight and remaining in the top two right until the fabled 4.20pm, the time of the famous tweet.

This year's EBD was one for the meta-culture. With many brands choosing to join in on Twitter by tweeting their name, or attempting to shoehorn some Balls-related pun into something (looking at you, Domino's), some were now asking: [are they ruining Ed Balls Day](https://econsultancy.com/blog/67796-are-brands-ruining-edballsday/)?

Having said that, there were some wonderful new Balls-related gifs doing the round - the standout one involving a large quantity of sausage rolls.

It's grown into such a 'thing' now that there were even mainstream news outlets live blogging the entire day. There's a job for work experience if I've ever seen one!

As time ticked on towards 4.20, the internet was building with anticipation. What would the man of the hour do?
