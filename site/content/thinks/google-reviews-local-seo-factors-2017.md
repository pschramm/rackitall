The definitive guide to [Local Search Ranking Factors](http://www.localseoguide.com/guides/local-seo-ranking-factors/) has recently been updated...and I wanted to share one thing in particular:

Here’s a graph showing a load of positive ranking factors for Google Business listings. Those are the ones that show up *at the top of page 1* in the map bit. They’re ordered from the strongest on the left downwards.[![](images/blog/Local-Ranking-Factors-Graph-2017.png)](http://www.localseoguide.com/guides/local-seo-ranking-factors/)

All the yellow ones are to do with *GOOGLE REVIEWS*!

If your business is getting them regularly, then great! Well done!!!

If not, it’s important you get a system in place whereby you can direct customers to leave you feedback on Google.

This could be giving them a flyer, asking them in person, or adding a link to an email.

‘Psychology of social proof’ is a thing, and it’s very powerful – hence why sites like TripAdvisor, Houzz etc exist as well.

You can put all the information you want about your own company online via website or social media, but people <u>will</u> seek out opinions from other sources to aid their opinion.

Perhaps you already aim to get Facebook reviews, Feefo reviews, Trustpilot reviews or similar?

Then perhaps spend a few months changing the process and diverting them to another Google, where they can do some extra good.

*And* – sorry to say - it’s not just as straightforward as just getting them…there’s some other elements in play as well.

These include: the keywords used in the review, the average you get a year/month/week, the number of reviews not responded to, the number of <u>negative</u> reviews not responded to, and loads more!

The full list is below.

*Having good reviews makes your business more likely to be found by potential customers who are interested in your product or service. *

So don’t be afraid to ask clients for feedback – *and don’t baulk at the idea because you may have gotten a bad one in the past*.

If you get one 1-star review for every eight 5-star reviews, you’ll still be at 4.5 out of 5, which is great! (To be honest, 4.x/5 looks more genuine than a solid 5/5 anyway!)

It’s too much of factor nowadays and you don’t want to be left behind by your competitors.

So give good customer experience etc, ask for reviews, get reviews, reply to all reviews, *good or bad*, and then sit back and relax knowing your business looks like it’s the best around! (Which, of course, it is!)

Good luck! &#x1f60a;
