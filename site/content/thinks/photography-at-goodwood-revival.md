Every September for the past 18 years, Goodwood Motor Circuit has opened its doors to 200,000+ historic racing fans to experience the Goodwood Revival, a period-style festival celebrating the racing years of Goodwood between 1948 and 1966. It’s a nostalgic and remarkably authentic throwback to mid 20th-century motorsport.

I first attended the event many years ago as a secondary school student but hadn't been back since. With a keen passion for motorsport and a rejuvinated love for photography, this year seemed like the perfect time to visit the Revival again.

I had the opportunity to attend on Friday, the opening day of the festival. Dressed in a three-piece suit and armed with my trusty Nikon D750 and a selection of lenses, I set about capturing the atmosphere of the day...

It was a pretty early start when the alarm woke me at 05:15. I caught the first train to Chichester and boarded a vintage bus into the circuit at 07:45. Getting in early meant beating the rush of 75,000 fans crowding into the somewhat cosy paddock area.

Unlike at the [Festival of Speed](http://www.trysmudford.com/fos-2016/), the main paddock for the Revival was closed off to the general public. As this is treated as a genuine race weekend for all involved, the paddock is a bustling hive of activity where mechanics and drivers tend and tune their 70 year old cars. This restriction does limit photographic opportunities a little but by arriving early, I was still able to capture what I wanted.

The other paddocks were open to all and gave much greater access, even if a high proportion of the cars were just Austin A35’s! There were still some very impressive cars on show including this 1948 Frazer Nash High Speed. A Le Mans replica by the same marque [sold at Bonhams](http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/23595/lot/170/) on Saturday for a mere £603,333!

Friday is traditionally the practise and qualifying day before the racing begins on Saturday. However, this didn’t stop the drivers giving it their all in cars worth a sizable fortune.

The largest near-miss of the weekend had to be on Sunday afternoon when a Jaguar E-type span and narrowly missed a *£30 million* Ferrari 250 GTO by a couple of inches!

## Lenses

When I attended [Goodwood Festival of Speed](http://www.trysmudford.com/fos-2016/) earlier this year, I hired in three additional lenses including a monstrous Sigma 150-600mm super-telephoto. It was brilliant to have such a choice of glass but it did weigh a huge amount and I was able to split the load between two of us. For the Revival, I went on my own and didn’t fancy carrying around heavy lenses if I could get away with it.

This time, I decided to take three: 20mm f/1.8, 85mm f/1.8 and 24-120mm f/4. Each lens brought something a bit different to the mix.

The 20mm prime was the widest lens and was useful in the paddock and indoors where space was a premium. As it stops down to an aperture of 1.8, I could run a pretty low ISO even in lower light situations.

The 85mm is a stunning portrait lens and I used this quite a lot whilst wandering around the paddock area when I wanted to focus in on subjects.

The 24-120mm was my main lens for the day. The ability to zoom gave me great flexibility out on track and in the paddock. Although I do like the challenge of shooting with a prime lens, there’s something comforting about the option to zoom, especially as I only had one body to shoot with.

The maximum zoom of 120mm was adequate for the most part but I could’ve done with a bit of extra reach at parts of the track. The 150-600mm that I hired for the Festival of Speed would’ve been far too much to lug around; a 70-200mm f/2.8 would’ve been ideal.

## Shutter speeds &amp; panning

One of the most important aspects of shooting motorsports is giving the impression of speed. Depending on the camera settings, it’s possible to make a moving subject look anywhere between static and speeding.

A camera on an automatic mode will generally try to get the image as sharp as possible and will therefore shoot with a much higher speed, something like 1/2000th - 1/4000th of a second. With shots this quick, almost all motion is frozen in time, which can give the impression of a stationary object. In the past, I shot like this; it was a guaranteed way of achieving sharp photographs. Here’s an example from Goodwood Festival of Speed 2013:

![](images/blog/664647_10152131975944572_1185060744_o-1024x683.jpg)

It’s a reasonable photograph that shows off the Lotus F1 car going up the Goodwood hillclimb. However, it’s not clear how quick the car is moving or how hard the driver is having to work to wrestle it up the hill. The car, the tyres and the hay bales behind are all razor-sharp; for all we know, this car could’ve broken down and parked here!

As I have grown as a photographer, I have experimented with lower shutter speeds. The movement of the tyres and the blurring of the background give real impressions of the subject’s speed.

![](images/blog/TRM_9398-1024x684.jpg)

![](images/blog/TRM_9455-1024x684.jpg)

Neither method is right or wrong, it’s all about opinion and both have a time and a place.

With a lower shutter speed, you have to move with the car to keep it sharp, if not you get something a bit like this:

![](images/blog/TRM_8991-1024x684.jpg)

![](images/blog/TRM_9405-684x1024.jpg)

Again, this a very usable effect that does a good job of highlighting the background detail without putting too much focus on the foreground subject.

To keep the subject sharp, you have to pan the camera at the same speed. This is a movement that takes a good while to get perfected. The more practise you have, the more you’ll be able to shoot consistently with very low shutter speeds.

I started out at 1/125th of a second before working down to 1/20th of a second. A professional photographer will be practised enough to consistently shoot at 1/15th - 1/10th of a second. My 1/20th of a second shots were pretty hit and miss!

### A segue on quality

The key is not to get bogged down with shots that don’t work out. Prepare yourself for that and aim for a low number of shots that you’re really happy with. In 2013, I naively thought that I’d get hundreds of brilliant photographs, but looking back now, I realise that I only hit one part of that statement: hundreds of photographs!

After a hiatus from photography, I came back to it this year with a more realistic target. My first event was my sister's wedding in April and I set myself a target to get 10 shots I was really happy with. On the day, I surpassed that target and it felt brilliant! I took a lot of rubbish photos but it didn’t matter, the few really great shots were enough.

Anyway…back to panning and shutter speeds!

### Shutter speed &amp; panning part 2

The lower the shutter speed, the greater the background blur. Below are four images taken at 1/125, 1/100, 1/60 &amp; 1/30th of a second. You should see less definition in the background (and therefore greater focus on the foreground) on the lower speed images:

![](images/blog/TRM_8875-1024x684.jpg "1/100th of a second")

![](images/blog/TRM_8901-1024x684.jpg "1/60th of a second")

![](images/blog/TRM_8962-1024x684.jpg "1/30th of a second")

### Optic Flow

I found that when I was shooting on the start/finish straight within a couple of meters of the cars, I wasn’t able to shoot anywhere near 1/20th of a second. If I tried, the car was never sharp. This is down to what's called Optic Flow.

Optic Flow is the effect that makes closer subjects appear to move faster than subjects further away. To this end, when shooting a near subject, the shutter speed doesn’t have to be as low because the shorter camera-to-subject distance means they appear to be travelling faster past you.

![](images/blog/TRM_9356-1024x684.jpg)

### Focus points

It’s important to choose part of the subject to focus on. Due to the length of time needed for a panned shot, you have to approach it more like a video where each frame is stacked on top of the other frames. If the focused area shifts during the shot, different parts of the subject will be focused on different frames causing the overall image to be very blurred.

Depending on the direction and speed of the subject, you may find that only a small part of the subject is fully in focus. This can work as a great effect to focus the image on a specific portion of the subject.

## The weather

Although better than the washout on Saturday, Friday’s weather wasn’t brilliant. It was dry most of the day but the sky was pretty grey and dull which doesn’t make for a great photograph. Although with some high contrast added in editing, it was possible to pick out some pretty moody shots.

Goodwood Revival 2016 provided a great day out. There was great racing and a brilliant atmosphere. I could’ve done with at least another day to get the most out of it but I was pretty happy with the photographic results from the day.

Now looking forward to the Members Meeting in March 2017!
