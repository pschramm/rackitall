With August traditionally being a quiet time for a lot of businesses, it's the perfect time to buff up your website and make sure it's ship shape for September and the lead up to Christmas. You don't want to leave it until you're busy again and it's too late...

Here's our quick checklist of things you should get sorted before the kids go back to school:

## 1. Check for out of date content

When was the last time you properly read through your website? You can bet there have been changes in your business since then.

Pay particular attention to your Home page, any Services or Products pages and your About us pages.

As well as looking for clearly out-of-date information, make sure your content's still relevant and focuses on the right areas of your business.

Could a change of emphasis lead to increased sales or enquiries?

## 2. Check links to external websites still work

It's one thing making sure the links to other pages on your own site work, but what about links to other, external sites or pages that you've got no control over?

Run through all the pages on your site and make sure that the links a) work and b) are going to the page you expect them to.

I've heard plenty of tales of pages that have been moved and replaced by something rather inappropriate...

## 3. Get your Google Plus page up to date

If you work within certain local geographical boundaries, a [Google Plus listing](https://plus.google.com/+TomangoCoUk) is a must.  These often appear above other listings when a search includes a place name.

If you haven't got a listing already, get one set up - it's free and easy to do (or we can do it for you). Make sure  you complete as much of the detail as possible and, as with point 1 above, if you've had one for a while, make sure it's up to date.

## 4. Review your Google Analytics stats (or set it up if you haven't already)

How often do you look at your Google Analytics statistics?

I mean, *really* have a look at them, rather than just glancing at the headline figures?

Set aside 20 minutes, get logged in and have a little explore.

If it's been a while, look back over a longer period of time than the default one month. Look at 6 months or even a year. Delve into where your traffic has come from, which keywords were used and which pages were viewed most frequently. You might uncover a couple of gems of info that will get you thinking about how you could get more out of your site...

## 5. Make sure you're mobile-friendly

If you missed it already, from 21st April 2015, Google changed the way they rank websites to favour those that are optimised for smartphones and tablets. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, your search results will start to be affected.

First, check your Google Analytics and have a look at how many of your visitors were using a mobile or tablet. You'll find it under Audience &gt; Mobile &gt; Overview.

If you're not mobile-friendly, all these visitors to your site are having a poor experience which could be harming your sales. The stats above were taken from a site that hasn't yet been made mobile-friendly. Take a look at the bounce rate figures on the far right and compare the mobile row with desktop - visitors on a mobile are far less likely to stay on your site if it's hard to use on their device.

We recommend that your site is made *responsive*, so it adapts to fit the size of the screen being used.

If you haven't done so already, contact your web developer about making your site responsive.

## 6. Add links to your social media pages

If you're using Social Media, make it easier for visitors to find you on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or anywhere else you're active by adding the distinctive "Follow" icons to your site.

Depending on how prominent you want the link to be beteween your site and your social media accounts, these could appear in the header (if you're a social media champ) or in the footer (if you're a newbie).
