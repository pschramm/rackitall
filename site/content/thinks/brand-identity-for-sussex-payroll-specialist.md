Ever wondered what the difference is between a logo and a [brand identity](/creates/brand/)?

Last week we completed a new brand identity for a Sussex payroll specialist based just up the road in nearby Uckfield.

## Our client - Pay Assist

We were approached by Pay Assist - an [outsourced payroll services](http://www.pay-assist.co.uk/payroll-services/) company based in Uckfield - in January to design and develop the brand identity.

It was clear from the outset that [Pay Assist](http://www.tomango.co.uk/created/pay-assist/) was a client that didn't just need a logo throwing together. They appreciated what it means to have a brand identity created and how important it is to the success of a business.

And that's why they came to Tomango.

## Understanding the brief

The first key difference between having a logo designed and having a brand identity created is in understanding what's needed and why.

We get this process started by asking the client to complete a questionnaire-style document. We find this format works really well at getting the client to think about their business and what they're trying to achieve. It's also important they get to take the questionnaire away with them and fill it in at their own pace, giving them the time to properly think about each answer without feeling under pressure, which might happen in a face-to-face meeting.

This face-to-face meeting still happens, but that's the next step. Our designer met with Pay Assist's Head of Marketing, to walk through the questionnaire and talk in more detail about some of the answers they'd given us.

This gave us the opportunity to dig a bit deeper and find out more about the business, and to pick up other signals that you only get from talking to someone in person.

## Research

After the briefing stage has been completed, we're off and running and into the exciting creative bit. But, tempting though it is to pick up pencil and paper and start scribbling, our designers will instead spend lots of time doing crucial research.

We'll research the competition, because you need to stand out from the crowd.

We'll research your market, because the more we understand about your business, the better your brand will be at helping you reach your goals.

And when we're happy that we've got a good idea of what we're working with, we start the design process.

## Choosing a typeface

The first step with most brand projects is choosing the right typeface.

This is a vital step, as it sets the tone for the whole brand. It's not uncommon for us to spend as much as a day just looking for and selecting a typeface. Continually referring back to the brief, we'll find the font that sets the right tone and captures our client's unique brand values.

## The Pay Assist Typeface - Yummo

For the Pay Assist brand, our Creative Director Mike settled on a font called Yummo, identifying that all the appropriate elements were in place to fit the brief;

Reliable yet friendly; strong but approachable; high quality but affordable.

## Adding a descriptor

There was an underlying concern that was bothering us during the design stage about the company name.

We felt there was a chance that to some people, the name might sound a bit like a payday loan company, which isn't an industry with a particularly positive image.

To negate this, we introduced a descriptor "Payroll Services" to the brand. When we presented the concept to the client, it was clear they hadn't thought of this, but they agreed it was important.

Another example of the importance of a well-thought out approach to a brand identity project.

## Perfecting the type

Here's where attention to detail really makes the difference.

There were three elements of the evolving brand identity that [Mike](/is/mike-vine/) felt needed attention.

![](images/blog/pay-assist-brand-identity3.jpg "The three areas that needed attention. Can you spot the problems?")

First, the spacing between the letters wasn't even. You can see that the distance between the "y" of Pay and the "a" of Assist is more than the space between the other letters. Visually this looked disjointed.

Second, the bottom edge of the "y" (not to be confused with the tail) wasn't in line with the bottom of the other letters. As you read the words, your eye travels up slightly, then back down again, which again looked messy and was distracting.

Thirdly, the "i" of Assist wasn't in line with the top of the "t". The phrase "dotting the I's and crossing the T's" kept coming to mind, which is all about accuracy; an important principle from the design brief.

![](images/blog/pay-assist-brand-identity6.jpg "The dot of the "i" is aligned with the top of the "t")

![](images/blog/pay-assist-brand-identity8.jpg "The brand is much improved after these amendments")

## Colour

Up to this point we haven't even looked at colour.

Again, Mike carried out lots of research before making his final choice. It's just not right to choose a colour based on a personal preference, either of the designer or the client. Colour has a very powerful effect on our emotions and  fundamentally changes how we feel about brands.

For Pay Assist, Mike selected green, which as well as being the colour of nature, is associated with harmony, safety and money. It was the ideal choice for this brand.

The green is complemented by a dark grey. An alternative to 100% black, it softens the brand, lending it a more approachable and friendly feel.

## Colour balance

Mike then explored different options of how the colours should work together.

![](images/blog/pay-assist-brand-identity101.jpg "Various uses of the colour palette were explored")

Eventually he settled on the main brand in grey and the descriptor and dot of the "i" in green as being the best balanced and most "on brief".

## Checking the brand works in different scenarios

At all points during the creative process, we test our ideas against the design brief. If it fails at any time, that's not good enough. We'll go back a step and look again to find the right answer.

![](images/blog/pay-assist-brand-identity12.jpg "Here we check that the brand works in mono, in reverse and on a photograph")

Below, you can see where we have checked the legibility of the brand identity at small scale. We need to make sure it could be printed on the side of a pen, or a teeny tiny memory stick; we don't want our client to be limited in what they can do with their brand.

## Helping the client visualise the brand

A very important step in the presentation process is when we show the client how the brand might look in situ. In this example, we mocked up some business stationery with the brand in place. It's rare to see a brand used on a plain white background in "real life", so we presented these designs to help them visualise how the brand might eventually look.

## The finished brand identity

So here it is; the completed brand identity. The client agreed with us that it met the brief perfectly, achieving the delicate balance between the reliability and strength of a market leader but keeping an approachable, friendly and accessible feel.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, having someone "throw a logo together" isn't enough. If you're serious about growing your business to its full potential, you need a brand identity.

A brand identity that's carefully put together, based on sound logic.

It really will make a difference to how customers see you, and can make the difference between making or losing the sale.

We'd love to find out how we can help you.
