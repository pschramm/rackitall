Well-crafted website content is the key to increasing web traffic and more importantly, getting enquiries and making sales.

*In this article we look at 6 top tips for creating brilliant website content.*

## 1.    Content is king

Everyone loves fresh content – search engines and customers alike. If you do one thing on your website, it's well worth spending your time regularly creating new, interesting content for your website, which is why blogs are so popular. A relevant and informative article once a week will make a big difference; if you can manage one every day then you’ll really be in business.

## 2.    Writing for search engines AND the customer

It’s important to include your keywords within your content so search engines can pick them up, however…don’t forget it still needs to make sense to visitors reading it, and should be persuasive so they follow up their interest with ACTION.  Striking this balance is the key to a successful and hard-working website.

## 3.    Using headings and bullets

Web users have the attention span of three year olds, so keep it brief.  Keep. Sentences.  Short.  Use headers to break up larger areas of text and bulleted lists to help visitors scan or skim-read.

## 4.    Use of images

Use images to reinforce your message – either by relevance to the topic you’re writing about or by creating visual impact.  Captions are useful too, and don’t forget to add a keyword-rich “alt tag”, which the search engines can read.

## 5.    Presenting complex data, such as tables

Give some careful thought to how you present more complex data such as price tables, "features and benefits" comparisons and the like.  These are the details that can seal the deal so make them easy to read and digest.

## 6.    Call to action

You’ve got them to your site, you’ve captivated them with your beautifully crafted copy and they’re sold – they want to do business with you - so what happens next?  *Don’t let them get away!*  Make it as easy as possible for them to follow up by including a compelling call to action.  This could be a link to your contact page, an email link or your telephone number – whichever suits you best.
