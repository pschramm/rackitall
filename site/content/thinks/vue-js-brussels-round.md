I'm back at work after an exciting trip to Brussels, attending a three-day [Hackages](https://hackages.io/) training course on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) run by [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi), the creator of the framework. It was so inspiring and useful to be able to ask him questions and understand his motives behind the project.

I wrote a blog post each evening, cherry picking the highlights from my 37 pages of notes:

## Day 1

We kicked off by running through the high-level concepts in Vue.js then through all the foundational building blocks of the framework. I was aware that as I have some experience with Vue, it could've been less useful day. It was anything but. There were loads of tips, tricks and concepts that I picked up.

## Day 2

Transitions, Vue CLI, routing and state management were on the schedule for day 2. The highlight was the deep-dive into how Vue.js works with mutability, rather than quash it like other frameworks.

## Day 3

The third and final day of the workshop tackled advanced Vue concepts including custom directives, plugins and mixins. Then we hit render functions, functional, async, abstract &amp; higher order components to round out the workshop.

Then I jumped in a taxi back to the station and was home in drizzly England two hours later!

It was a brilliant deep-dive into Vue.js and I learned a huge amount. I now feel so much more confident in the framework and Iâ€™m ready to get stuck-in to using it soon!
