With the Tomango summer party just over two weeks away, we reflect on the different backgrounds and businesses of our guests and the wide range of services we now provide for them.

Before we merged to become *Tomango*, both Blue Planet and Jupiter Colour were formed as [website design](/creates/web/) companies, but now we're about so much more than that.  Our "vision" for Tomango was to be the best [brand identity design](/creates/brand/), [website design](/creates/web/) and [online marketing company](/creates/online-marketing/) in Sussex.

## Brand identity

Your brand identity is the visualisation of your values, how you go about your business and your place in the market.  It gives your customers an immediate message about who you are and what's you're about.

### Oldfield &amp; Smith

[Oldfield &amp; Smith](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk) approached us in the spring of 2013 to ask us to develop their brand identity and website.  [Oldfield &amp; Smith](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/) is a new [commercial letting agent](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/what-we-do/agency/) based in Uckfield, established by [Richard Oldfield](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/who-we-are/richard-oldfield/) and [Bernard Smith](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk/who-we-are/bernard-smith/).

Their brand identity needed to express quality of service,  combining the highest professional standards with a warm, open and honest service.  The image they want to portray is approachable, honest, professional, results-driven and enthusiastic.

The final brand identity fits this brief but also sets them apart from their competition and works in a wide range of scenarios; it looks great on their business stationery, sale boards and [website](http://www.oldfield-smith.co.uk) and works equally well whether large or small, colour or monochrome.

### Sussex Letting Shop

[Sussex Letting Shop](http://www.sussexlettingshop.co.uk) is part of the Geneva Investment Group Ltd and is one of the largest private landlords in Brighton &amp; Hove with over 700 unfurnished letting units in and around Sussex. The company owns, manages and lets all of its properties and offers bedsits, studio flats, 1, 2 and 3 bedroom flats and up to 4 bedroom houses.

When we met the guys at Geneva the new brand just had a name – there was no brand identity, no marketing materials or business stationery and no website.

Our brief was to create a new brand identity for the business, then design and roll out business stationery and a new website to fit.

{{< quote
	body="From the initial email that was sent to *Tomango* as a brief tentative outline of what we were looking to achieve to the launching of our brand new site in February, we have had an exceptionally positive experience. The team at Tomango has been a pleasure to work with and we have all learnt so much. We would have no hesitation in recommending their services."

## Web

The largest part of our business is still website design and development.  We love the challenge of working on different types of web project and pushing our skills - both design and technical - to new limits.  Here's a couple of recent projects that we found particularly interesting:

### Taxi Rater

Taxi Rater is a new web-based business started by entrepreneur Trevor Tomes. The site allows users to compare fares of a number of different taxi firms for the same journey, saving the time and hassle of phoning round for different quotes.

Trevor has over 25 years experience in the taxi industry and when he first contacted us, he had the broad idea in place but the details relating to how the fares would be calculated and results displayed weren't established.  Following a thorough consultation process, we worked out a detailed specification that we could work from to design and build the website.

The challenge in producing the site was to effectively carry the new brand identity (which we also created) through to the site whilst providing an easy-to-use interface for the user.

We did a lot of work with integration of Google Maps to calculate routes and fares which needed fine-tuning to deal with all the nuances of how taxi companies worked out their prices.

### Alison Buchanan

[Alison Buchanan](http://www.alisonbuchanan.co.uk/) is a wedding and portrait photographer.  Her previous website was quite basic but she really wanted a site that would help to showcase her photography and generate work from new clients.  She also needed to integrate a blog that would enable her to post updates about assignments and help with her online marketing.

Given what Alison does for a living, we wanted to increase the impact that the site had on its visitors and create a real wow factor for visitors.  The design for this site was always going to be different to other sites that sell products or services; this really had to be all about the images and how users associated them with the photography they wanted for their own events.

The blog element is vital to the marketing of the website but to continue the high impact of the site, we decided to create two distinctive blog types; the first was a story-style post where Alison could upload a text overview of an event and then add a storyboard of images. The second was a more "standard" post style where Alison could talk about elements of photography or specific photos she has taken; these would include individual images that could be enlarged to show more detail.

## Online marketing

Since *Tomango* started trading in January, the [online marketing](/creates/online-marketing/) part of our business has grown quite considerably.  Our expertise has enabled us to deliver sustainable and significant results for our clients and this has led to referrals as word has spread.  Here are a couple of good examples of work we've undertaken recently:

### Authentic Reclamation

Authentic Reclamation is based on the Kent and Sussex border and supplies reclaimed building materials to the whole of the South East including Surrey and South London. It has been sourcing and supplying reclaimed building materials to the building, landscaping and private sectors for more than 20 years.

In 2009, Authentic Reclamation was really struggling.  The company directors recognised the potential of marketing their website as a way to turn the business around.  Our brief was (and continues to be) to increase the number of visitors coming to the site and convert as many of them as possible to enquiries.

This has been an ongoing project over the last 3 years.  Typically planning six months in advance, and working closely with the directors, we have targeted specific keywords and gradually increased the number of pages on the website.

*The results*

The number of vistors to the website has soared from an average of 1,100 per month at the end of 2010 to an average of 11,000 per month at the end of 2012* – an increase of 1000%*.
