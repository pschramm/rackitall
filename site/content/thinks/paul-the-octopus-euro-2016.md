Unless you've been living in a cave the last month or so you'll know that next week sees the start of Euro 2016!

With it will inevitably come England's exit in the last 16 - but here at Tomango we want the fun to go on all tournament, so for the last month we've been working on a way to ensure that's the case.

Enter - *[Paul the Octopus](http://www.paultheoctop.us).*

![](images/blog/PTO-logo.jpg)For those of you who are lucky enough to have memories stretching back to 2010, you'll remember this little critter became a media sensation during the World Cup in South Africa.

It became apparent to the wider world that Paul had an uncanny knack of predicting the winners of football matches - in fact he ended that tournament with a *perfect record* of 8 out of 8.

Paul the Octopus - or 'Die Krake Paul' as he was known in his native Germany - became so powerful in his prophesising he eventually received death threats after predicting his home nation would lose in the semi-finals to Spain, prompting the Spanish Prime Minister to offer him state protection.

He even received his own [Google Doodle](http://www.google.com/doodles/world-cup-2014-14).

So now, courtesy of our lead web developer Trys, we present our very own [prediction game](http://www.paultheoctop.us) in Paul's honour!

## The Game

Paul the Octopus (the game) lets you predict the actual scores of each game of the finals.

In traditional football style, a winning prediction nets you *three points*. An incorrect score, but a correct result, gets one *point*.

You can see how your predicted tables look compared to the real thing, and - to add to the fun - we've added a number of additional challenges, including:

- Winning overall team (5 extra points)
- Number of goals (10)
- Number of cards (8)
- Who will win England's group (2)
- How many goals will England score (3)
- Dirtiest team (3)
- First team out (1 point)


Every user will be entered into the main league AND you can create leagues and invite your friends as well.

The Vote Leave campaign may have [got the jump on us last week](https://50million.uk/) - and we're not offering £50 million to a winner either. We might stretch to a couple of packets of Euro 2016 stickers, or perhaps even a size 3 football if you're lucky.

So what are you waiting for?!

Head on over to [www.paultheoctop.us](http://www.paultheoctop.us) right now and get in the game!
