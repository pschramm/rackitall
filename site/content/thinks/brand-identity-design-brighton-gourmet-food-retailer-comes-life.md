There's little in my professional life that gives me greater satisfaction than seeing a [brand identity](/creates/brand/) that we've created come to life. Seeing Tomango's work in print or on the high street gives me a lovely little warm glow inside. Last week I was fortunate enough to see our client's brand hard at work in a newly opened gourmet food deli in Brighton; the new home of Sage &amp; Relish.

## What is Sage &amp; Relish?

Sage and Relish is a new independent retailer and wholesaler that sells premium food products sourced from the very best artisan producers across the Mediterranean.  The shop is principally a delicatessen offering high-end packaged gourmet foodstuffs, but you also get the chance to taste the final product (as a snack, lunch or dinner) before buying the ingredients and trying it for yourself at home.

The business was founded by Greek couple Stefanos Lianakis and Angeliki Zafeiropoulou, and when they first called us on a cold morning in January 2014, they didn't even have a company name, let alone a brand identity.  Over the next couple of months, we worked closely with them to come up with a name for the business and then created a visual brand identity to position them perfectly in their marketplace.

Stefanos and Angeliki realised early on the value in investing in their brand identity and allocated a significant portion of their overall marketing budget to get the right name and visual identity for their fledgling business.

### Establishing a brand name

The first step was for us to produce a name that captured their brand values and unique proposition.  This proved to be pretty tricky, as the business has many facets and because it sells food from all across the Mediterranean; a region that's difficult to succinctly define.  A number of possible names were put forward, before Stefanos and Angeliki settled on Sage &amp; Relish, playing as it does on the culinary and attitudinal meanings of the two words.

### Creating the brand identity

Under the guidance of our Creative Director [Mike Vine](/is/mike-vine/), we created a brand identity that captured the personality of the business. The strong and confident typography reflects how Stefanos and Angeliki run their business, and the potential for using the brand identity across packaging, signage and online material fits the brief perfectly.

## Taster evening

Since we completed the brand in March 2014, Stefanos and Angeliki have been busy pulling together the hundred and one things that need doing before opening a high street shop in the 21st century. There were lots of things that took longer than anticipated, and many late and sleepless nights as the couple battled away to get the shop open. The Tomango team couldn't wait to see how it would look...

And so it came to the summer and we received the long-awaited news that the shop was finally open. A few months later, we were invited by Stefanos and Angeliki to come to the second of their taster evenings, where they were giving customers the chance to taste a selection of their new products and learn about where they were produced and how to use them to create delicious dishes.

Last week I went along, and I was so thrilled with how the shop looks and how the brand identity has been rolled out across the various printed and display materials to such good effect. Despite being on a pretty tight budget, Stefanos and Angeliki have done a fantastic job in producing quality-looking printed material for the shop - business cards, information flyers and bags - as well as fitting out the interior with an original and very cool look.

The products on view were amazing. If you're into your food, you're likely to do what I did and spend a good 20 minutes or so doing circuits of the shop wrestling with your decision as to what to buy. And whether you spend a few pounds on an authentic jar of Greek honey, or £65 on a 19 year-aged bottled of balsamic vinegar, you know that you'll be getting the very best that the Mediterranean has to offer.

Thanks for the invite Stefanos and Angeliki, and it's been an absolute delight working with you both. We look forward to seeing the shop go from strength to strength!
