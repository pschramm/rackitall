For the past six months we’ve been using a website called [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) - a prototyping and collaboration tool. The concept is simple - upload the designs, share with the client and they then leave feedback.

Before we started using InVision it seemed to be a long process in reaching a final design. This used to involve a large number of emails and telephone conversations back and forth, with the client having to explain where and what they required changing. Using the note tool within InVision, the client can add a pin to the exact area they want to change which allows us to quickly pin point what part of the design they are talking about.

Another key feature are 'Boards'; these provide organisational tools for creating context around a project for presentations, asset management, and more. Layout options allow you to create visual hierarchy for ideas.

Boards also allow commenting and downloading, bringing the design process together into a familiar, central location. Plus, you can share your Boards with clients and other team members.

InVision can easily be integrated with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and project management tools such as [Slack ](https://slack.com/)and [Trello](https://trello.com/). We use Dropbox as a backup just in case files are accidentally deleted from the InVision app.

Needless to say, we’re having fun using InVision and we can’t wait to see what new features are rolled out in the coming months.
