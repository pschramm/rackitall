So it's goodbye lazy summer evenings and hello to driving home in the dark. But there's no need to panic, Christmas will be here before you know it...

Here's what we've been up to during October.

## Mike

At the beginning of the month Mike worked closely with our good friends at [Agon Systems](http://www.agon-systems.com) to prepare for their appearance at the [Retail Fraud Show](http://www.retailfraud.com/retail-fraud-show/), which took place at the beginning of the month. This involved designing flyers to be left on delegates' chairs, managing the printing of A4 wallets and their inserts, and most importantly creating the keynote speech presentation for Tim Edwards, Group Loss Control Director at [JD Sports](http://www.jdsports.co.uk/).

Mike's also following on from creating the new brand identity for Dando Drilling with the design of their new website, and [Sussex Oak &amp; Restoration Materials](http://www.tomango.co.uk/created/sussex-oak/) have signed off a new brand identity ahead of the design and build of their website which is booked in towards the end of the year.

## Trys

Trys has been kept very busy with the development of the new [Monkey Wellbeing](https://www.monkeywellbeing.com/) website, which went live in the last week of the month. For those that may have missed it previously, Monkey Wellbeing is a fantastic brand that helps children recover from hospital visits more quickly. We're extremely proud to be involved with this worthwhile project and are delighted with how the new website has turned out.

Trys has also been working on a new website for Red Letter Life Stories. [Red Letter](http://www.redletterbooks.co.uk/) has been a Tomango client for several years and we built their main website for their biography writing business. They're now looking to make their service accessible to more people and we're building an online system to help make this happen.

And finally, in his spare time, Trys knocked up a splendid little [Times Table web app](http://trysmudford.com/lab/times/). Prompted by Mark being too lazy to think up random times tables questions for his daughters, Trys has created a simple but very elegant tool to automatically fire multiplication questions at your offspring. [Give it a spin](http://trysmudford.com/lab/times/) and see how good your arithmetic really is...

## Mark

Mark's been working on a couple of new projects this month. Firstly, our long-time client [Galen Therapy](http://www.caninetherapy.co.uk/) has asked us to design and build them an online training system for its Canine Myotherapy business.

Then there's Healthcare Business, a magazine edited by the lovely Viv Shepherd, for which we're building a blog-style news site to take the magazine fully online. Viv was referred to us by the good people at [Care Home Insurance](http://www.care-home-insurance.co.uk) Services (CHIS) and having completed the planning process for the site, the design stage gets underway next week.

Finally, the long-term project of the new Tomango website is building up a head of steam. Mark's finished the copy for the new site ahead of its likely launch in the New Year and photography is being planned for December.

## Julian

Julian's been working very hard managing the Monkey Wellbeing project, working closely with the client to get the details right prior to the soft launch mentioned above.

In addition, he's also been working with Naomi Sautter of NS Weddings &amp; Events, a [wedding planner in hampshire](http://www.nsweddingsandevents.com). Naomi graduated from University earlier this year and is now turning her full attention to her business that she first started running whilst completing her studies.

## Elliot

Elliot's had a busy month, working closely with Mike preparing the JD Sports presentation for the Retail Fraud Show, carefully compiling the twenty or so slides for Tim Edwards' keynote speech. We're happy to report that the presentation went down very well in the hall.

On top of that, look out for a forthcoming group of blog posts that Elliot's putting together on his specialist subject of Content Design. He'll be sharing with you valuable research findings that will help make your website more appealing, more engaging and most importantly of all more *effective*.
