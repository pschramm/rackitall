Remember the turn of the year when it was rumoured that Twitter was upping its limit from 140 characters to a whopping *10,000?*

Thank goodness that didn't happen! The think-pieces [were in full flow](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/how-will-a-10000-character-limit-change-twitter-marketing/632727) for the first couple of weeks of January, such was the drastic nature of the supposed changes. But after some backlash from a number of users, the idea was quietly dropped.

There's a small level of satisfaction when you manage to cram everything into the strict limitations of the platform; it's the brevity that keeps Twitter fast-paced and relevant by encouraging people to tweet in the moment the essence of what they want to communicate.

Twitter's famous 140 character limit was put in place when the site launched to ensure that Tweets would fit into SMS messages, but with the rise of smartphones and other platforms this is now largely obsolete.

Except, it's not really 140 characters. Not if you're doing it properly. If you want to add an image to the Tweet, that's about 24 characters worth. Stick a link on it as well and that's about the same.

So really you're working with around 90 to 95 characters...

But you won't be for much longer!

It was [announced this week](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/twitter-to-stop-counting-photos-and-links-in-140-character-limit-breaching-sites-most-defining-a7033611.html) that Twitter are to *stop *counting the images and links towards the character count, meaning you'll have around 40-50% more space to work in your message!

And as for *Google* - great news for SEOs that find it even harder to cram in a brand name and keywords into just 55-60 characters of a web page title!

As of right now, this has been *increased to around 70 characters*, due to the search engine increasing the width of search results from 500 to 600 pixels. That's an extra two to four words depending on how lengthy your keywords are.

So if you've been putting off doing some extra work on a load of titles and meta descriptions (yes, meta descriptions get an extra 10-15 characters per line), consider fitting in some time soon to give then a spruce up.
