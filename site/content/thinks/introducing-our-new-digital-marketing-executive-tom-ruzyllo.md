We have had a fresh addition to the Tomango team this week – allow me to introduce our newest (and tallest) team member…Tom Ruzyllo!

Tom joins us as our new Digital Marketing Executive, and will be looking after clients’ SEO campaigns, Google Analytics reporting and analysis, and PPC and social media management. He’s also briefed with giving our own online marketing strategy a re-jig, so watch this space!

His background is in journalism and PR, and he’s halfway through studying towards a [CIM Diploma in Professional Marketing](http://www.cim.co.uk/learning/qualifications/diploma-in-professional-marketing/) to further improve his knowledge in that area.

To round off his first week at Tomango I fired a few questions at him to get to know him a bit better…

*Welcome to the team, Tom; how was your first week?*

Brilliant! I can already see that I’m going to thoroughly enjoy the kind of work I’ll be doing here and I’m looking forward to seeing how far Tomango can go moving forward. It’s also fantastic that Tomango HQ is literally in the next village to where I live – I’m a full-on countryside lad (mine’s a cider) so that’s worked out well. Plus it gives me an extra 40 minutes in bed each morning!

*Where did you work before?*

Immediately before joining Tomango I was lead on communications at the British Parking Association (which isn’t as bad as it sounds), where I was in charge of email marketing for the membership base as well as overseeing the company website. Previously I had a stint up in London at Frank PR, spending my days trying to get coverage for a wide range of clients – covering everything from trains to beer!

> "Digital marketing is an area that I’m very passionate about, so it’s nice that it is now actually my job."

*What are you most looking forward to?*

Starting to make the most of the knowledge I’ve been getting from studying with CIM and really putting it into practice. Digital marketing is an area that I’m very passionate about, so it’s nice that it is now actually my job.

*So in your spare time – studying aside – what do you get up to?*

Well – I’m a season ticket holder at Brighton and Hove Albion, which has been *great* so far this season as they have been right in the mixer for promotion to the Premier League. I’m also a keen follower of cricket, and occasionally pick up a guitar for a bit of blues action.

*Any other hidden talents besides guitar?*

I once did a Rubik’s Cube in about two minutes, I can write [Teeline shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeline_Shorthand), and can name all the kings and queens of England in order for no reason whatsoever.

*If you could invite anyone (alive or dead) to a dinner party, who would it be?*

- Joe Root, FEC. That man makes me tweet ‘I Love Joe Root’ far too often…and only 25 (my age – what could have been!) Already the cricket media are running out of superlatives for him.
- Craig Ferguson – Scottish-US talk show host. Incredibly funny and clever guy who put a great spin on the talk show.
- David Gilmour – so I could spend the evening trying to convince him to call up Roger Waters, get the best band ever back together, and let me see them live.
- Cameron Diaz – a schoolboy crush that persists to this day.
- David Beckham – no explanation necessary.


*If your house was on fire and you could only save one thing, what would you grab?*

Nothing…let it burn and start over!

*An important one – do you like Christmas?*

I’ll watch Love Actually and Die Hard each December like any other normal person, but if I was in charge, Christmas songs would start being played around about the 15<sup>th</sup> of December…In a job way back in the day I was once stocking shelves with Cadbury Crème Eggs at *8am on New Year’s Day* – so I have fairly strong views on holidays being celebrated before their time comes!

*And finally, do you have any funny stories you’d like to share?*

I do have a good one that involves a three-man catapult, 10-15 fairly large oranges, an old man, two undercover police officers and a tin of white paint…but that’s not for online publication! If anyone wants to know more they can tweet me [@truzyllo](https://twitter.com/truzyllo).
