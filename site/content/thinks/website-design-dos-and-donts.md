Time for a rant.  Here are some of the things that really gets our goat about [website design](/creates/web/).  Make sure you don't fall into these traps...

We're often asked to take a look at websites and give our views on what could be improved.  Whilst we don't like to put other web designers down (it's really not our style), there are some examples of really bad design that really wind us up.  Don't let yourself get caught out by these (and if you have, fix them quick).

## Don't...


### 1. Don't Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Single Word

I've never understood this one.  Amongst some people (and we have clients who have done it) there's an obsession with Capitalizing Every Single Word In A Headline Or Menu Item.  See how daft that sentence looked?  We Don't Write Like This - so why do it on your website?

### 2. Don't underline something that's not a link

Sometimes you want something in your text to stand out.  In some cases you might want to make it *bold*, or possibly a <span style="color: #d70929;">different colour</span>, but whatever you do, DON'T UNDERLINE IT.  Why?  Because on a website, if something is underlined, it's a link.  That's the way it's always been, and when you see something that's underlined and you go to click on it, and find it's not a link... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">well, it's frustrating to say the least</span>.

### 3. Don't use "clever" names for your pages

We've all seen this one.  In an attempt to be clever or "different", a page that contains news is called "The Beat" or something equally cryptic and up-its-own-bottom.  What's wrong with "News", for goodness sake?  Never forget that the reason someone has come to your website is to find something - don't make it difficult by calling your pages something daft.  Label pages clearly and let visitors know what to expect when they follow the link.

### 4. Don't have pages "under construction"

This just looks lazy.  "Oh look, they couldn't think of anything to say about themselves" is what they will say.

Oh, and "coming soon", "we're working on it!" or "due to launch next month" won't cut it either (see point 3).

If you haven't bothered to come up with anything to say on one of your pages, leave it out.  You can always add it in again later.

### 5. Don't over use exclamation marks!!!

I have a bit of an issue with exclamation marks.  I don't really like them.  I rarely use them.  To me, it looks as if someone is trying too hard to be funny or a little bit "crazy".  They also look a bit cheap.

So don't overuse exclamation marks! And whatever you do, absolutely never, ever, ever use lots and lots of them at the end of a sentence to really emphasise something!!!!

Aaaarghh...

## Do...

After all that negativity, it's only fair to give you some sound advice about what you should do to get more out of your website.

### 1. Set realistic goals

Unfortunately, internet success stories like Twitter, Facebook and earlier Amazon and Google have left some people with the expectation that making squillions of pounds from a website is easy.  As with most things in life, the more you put in the more you get out and the internet is not really any different.

- Expect to have to provide some input into the creation of your website.
- Expect to have to at least take an interest in keeping it up to date and current.
- Expect to have to put in some time, effort and money to market your website and get people to come to it.


Be sure to have measurable goals, so that you can gauge whether your website has been "a success".  What do you want to achieve in the first year?  Perhaps a certain number of sales or enquiries, or maybe a certain number of visitors?  A good website designer should understand your goals from the first meeting and work out how they can help to make it happen.

### 2. Be prepared to put in some effort

There's no getting away from it - if you want to have a website that works well for you, you're going to need to make a bit of an effort.  Your website designer isn't a mind reader, and will never know as much about your business as you do.  They'll need your input for a design brief, the information you want to include on your site, the copy (or if they're writing the copy for you, they need to know what you want them to write about), and of course images.  And after the site is launched, if you want the site to be marketed effectively, they're going to need to know what keywords you want to target, which social networks might work best for your customers and so on.

### 3. Listen to advice from your web designer

This happens a lot, and it's very frustrating.  If you hire a website designer to design and build your website for you, I'm guessing you must consider them to be competent and capable of delivering what you want.  So why would you then completely ignore every bit of advice they give you about what makes a good website work?

A good website designer will have built up a lot of experience about good design, usability, search engine optimisation and much more.  Take on board what they have to say; trust them - they might just know what they're talking about.

### 4.Monitor and review your website's performance

Monitoring your website's performance is pretty easy.  By using tools like Google Analytics, you can quickly and easily see how many people have visited your site, where they came from and what they looked at.  It's free to use and you can even get reports emailed to your inbox whenever you want - so you don't even have to remember to login and see how it's going.

Comparison tools within Google Analytics will enable you to see trends - whether your website is busier this month than last month, or this quarter compared with the same quarter last year.

By monitoring and reviewing how your website is performing, you can make informed decisions about what you can do to improve it - and this will improve your bottom line.  Now that's worth caring about, isn't it?
