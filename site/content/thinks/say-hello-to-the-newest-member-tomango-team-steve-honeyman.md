Tomango has added to its growing team...

Please meet our new Junior Web Developer, Steve Honeyman.

Steve joined us on 15th August and comes from the University of Leeds, where he'd worked as a WordPress Developer for the last couple of years.

He's got a real passion for [web development](/creates/web/development/), and brings with him valuable experience in technical support, customer service and project management. He's keen to learn more about developing websites, online marketing and brand design - and I think it's fair to say he's looking forward to it:

After Steve's first week, I asked him a few quickfire questions to help you get to know him a bit better;

## Welcome to Tomango Steve; how was your first week?

Really good - I loved it!

## I trust the rest of the team have looked after you and made you feel welcome?

Everyone’s been fantastic. I’m really happy with - and excited by - my role here and I'm very much looking forward to the future - especially as Trys bakes such a mean Coffee Cake!

## What did you do in your previous job?

Before joining Tomango I managed and built websites for Leeds University and worked as a freelance web-designer and developer.

Before that I worked as a researcher for the NHS providing research that was used to commission healthcare in extremely deprived areas in and around West Yorkshire.

I also climbed rocks for several years and was very lucky to do that in the US, Switzerland, Spain, France and of-course, Yorkshire.

> "I *love* design and code."


## What do you like to do when you're not at work - do you still climb?

I love design and code so you'll often find me making things in Creative Suite, trying out new CSS tricks or exploring the dark recesses of the WordPress Codex.

If not hunched over my Macbook I love bouldering, and whilst injuries and pursuing my career as a developer have meant putting this part of my life on hold for a while, I still love to train and have been happily familiarizing myself with the local climbing walls over the last couple of weeks.

## If you could invite anyone (alive or dead) to a dinner party, who would you ask?

Jimi Hendrix.

I’d love to hear him play the black and white Fender Strat I bought whilst mesmerized by his playing as a kid.

## If your house was on fire and you could save just one thing, what would you grab?

It’d be a close call between my go-to climbing shoes, the aforementioned black and white Strat or my Macbook. After some soul-searching (though not too much obviously!) my Macbook would win out, sadly..

## And most importantly...Christmas; deck the halls, or bah humbug?

Move into the bunker?

No, it's true to say I'm not a *massive *fan of the festive season - but I'm quite happy to accommodate other people's enjoyment of it!

So there you have it.

Probably not the best person to call to offer up tips for a perfect Christmas, but if you've accidentally thrown your frisbee on the roof and need someone to shimmy up the drainpipe to fetch it - Steve's your man!
