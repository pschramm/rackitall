With today being ‘International Jazz Day’, I thought it was the perfect chance to share some of [Steve’s](/is/steve-honeyman) recent work and blogs, where he does a deep dive into what he calls “**a labour of love and typography**“.

In an attempt to to test his layout chops and partly to learn and explore new technologies and techniques in both HTML and CSS, he set off trying to recreate responsive versions of iconic jazz album covers!

The project entitled ‘Blue Notes’, proved so successful he eventually presented his work at two events – [WordUp Brighton](https://www.meetup.com/WordUp-Brighton/) and [WordCamp London](https://2018.london.wordcamp.org/).

Here are the links you need to enjoy this project in full:

- [Blue Notes: Iconic album sleeves recreated in the browser](http://stevehoneyman.co.uk/blog/blue-notes/) – a summation of the project, including approaches to layouts, typesetting, images and a number of handy code snippets.
- [WordCamp London](http://stevehoneyman.co.uk/blog/wordcamp/) – Steve’s blog for his second talk, drawing on his talk at WordUp Brighton, Steve demonstrated how to re-create and control multi-layered print style graphics in WordPress using Advanced Custom Fields.
- [Blue Notes](http://stevehoneyman.co.uk/blue-notes/) – the finished pieces in all their glory!
