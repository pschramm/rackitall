So the summer holidays are over, and with our tanlines fading fast, we return to the office rested and recharged and ready to launch into Autumn...

Here's what we've been up to during September.

## Mike

Early in the month Mike completed his design work for the first of the Pump Engineering websites and has now handed the project over to the development team to build.

At the same time, he's also been producing further marketing collateral for [Agon Systems](http://www.agon-systems.com), rolling out their shiny new brand identity across an A5 leaflet and A4 folder with inserts.

In the second half of the month, focus has shifted to a redesign of the [Monkey Wellbeing](http://www.monkeywellbeing.com/) website, which needs to be ready mid-October for a big PR campaign.  For those that don't know, Monkey Wellbeing is a fantastic brand that helps children recover from hospital visits more quickly.

Its range of books and Monkey puppet toy help little ones understand what to expect when they go to hospital, which has been scientifically proven to shorten recovery time.  It's a truly fantastic project that we're very proud to be involved with.

## Trys

Trys has been working hard developing the new website for Pump Engineering, working with Mike's designs to build a highly functional site that can be redeployed for future projects that PE has planned.

Towards the end of the month, Trys has become involved more heavily in the Monkey Wellbeing project, integrating Mike's designs with a feature-rich ecommerce website.

In addition to these two larger projects, he's also been developing some new features for the [Uckfield News](http://www.uckfieldnews.com) website, enabling them to manage advertising space and generate additional revenue from its growing audience.  Last time we looked, the site was enjoying over 80,000 page views a month, which is a fantastic achievement for this local news site and its editor, Cathy Watson.

## Mark

Mark has been focusing on the planning of several new projects this month, most notably the redesign of the Monkey Wellbeing site, ensuring the navigation and functionality fit with the user-journey the client wants to achieve.

There has also been a noticeable increase in the number of new client meetings as people return to work after the quieter summer months and we're quietly confident that a good chunk of them will ask us to start on their projects soon.

Finally, Mark's been kept busy because we've entered our staff appraisal season.  We fervently believe that a happy team is a productive team, and our appraisals give everyone on the team the opportunity to step back from the day-to-day and concentrate on the bigger picture stuff and how their careers can progress and remain fulfilling.

## Julian

Julian's time this month has been spent organising a complete translation of the [Agon Systems](/created/agon-systems/) website into French, German and Spanish, which will be made live by the start of October.  He's also been overseeing the Pump Engineering project, working with Trys to make sure the draft website is delivered to the client in accordance with the specification and project timetable, and working with the client to get their content into shape.

Finally, regular readers may recall that the draft website for The Shipping News was delivered at the end of last month.  Julian is now looking after the testing and feedback phase, to make sure the client benefits from a structured process and knows that they've been able to check everything is as it should be.

## Elliot

Elliot's been developing his project management skills this month, overseeing and coordinating others on a number of projects, including Agon Systems, where's he been in charge of implementing the translation of the website mentioned above.

He's also been looking after the latest round of updates for the lovely [Shirley Clarke](http://www.shirleyclarke-education.org/), improving their online booking system and updating the website with details about the latest book and DVD.  There are three people working on this site, and Elliot's had the challenge of coordinating everyone so that everything comes together by the end-of-month deadline.

## Jude

Jude's being kept very busy this month.  She's started a six month online marketing campaign (SEO and PPC) for Agon Systems, and is in the early stages of research for The Shipping News, planning the marketing campaign to coincide with its launch in around 6 weeks' time.

In addition to this, and keeping other clients' online marketing plates spinning, she's been organising our MacMillan coffee morning which takes place between 11am and 1pm on Friday 26th.  As well as raising lots of cash for this excellent charity, it's also an opportunity to get some of our clients together to share ideas and make new relationships.

## Nikki

As well as doing her hugely important rounds of invoicing, credit control and management of all things financial, Nikki's also been undertaking her biannual review of our web hosting customer base; ensuring everyone on our server still has a live site there (and is paying for it) and tidying up any stragglers that may have fallen through the net.
