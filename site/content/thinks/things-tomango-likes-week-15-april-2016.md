A quick round-up of the week as we pick out some of the highlights from the world of [Brand](/creates/brand/), [Web](/creates/web/), and [Online Marketing](/creates/online-marketing/).

## BRAND AND DESIGN: Domino's unveil new packaging design

Everyone knows that there's never any point in just buying one Dominos – Two for Tuesdays and other such offers mean that 96% of pizzas sold in the UK by the chain go in pairs.

Designers [JKR Global](http://www.jkrglobal.com/our-work/dominos/) were given the brief to revamp the Domino's brand packaging and produced this simple yet effective design, turning the Dominos logo into the packaging itself.

It’s a good piece of work that shows even the biggest companies can have a lot to gain by having a serious think about their design and brand identity.

> Tomango's creative director Mike Vine: "This is a great example of how a brand can be successfully rolled out with a recognisable experience at every touch point. In my opinion this is something every brand should aspire to do, as in doing so it can help build customer loyalty."

JKR Global said: “We wanted to celebrate Domino's distinctive and unique brand character by making it bold, simple and charismatic. We started by removing all the generic category communication from the boxes, focusing only on what Domino's owned: its once iconic red and blue domino logo.

“Knowing that 96 percent of all Domino's pizzas are sold in pairs, we decided to make the brand's logo pivotal to the design with one red box, one blue box. The result was bold, brave and simple packaging design. An open invitation for sharing and play.

## MARKETING AND PR: Waitrose celebrate start of Spring with seven day stream of UK farms

This is a fantastic example of an integrated marketing effort. Waitrose's new '[Spring' advertising campaign](http://waitrose.pressarea.com/pressrelease/details/78/NEWS_13/6176) will see a series of adverts produced across print and broadcast that take footage and photos from the previous 24 hours of activity on the Waitrose farm.

The opening TV advert, which will be filmed and broadcast today, comes from a dairy farm near Newbury that supplies milk to Waitrose. A future advert will show off the source of the free range eggs.

All the assets for these adverts are coming straight from a SEVEN DAY live stream on YouTube - watch below.

The campaign comes just weeks after rival supermarket Tesco launched a range of meat and produce using [made-up farm names](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/mar/22/tescos-fictional-farms-a-marketing-strategy-past-its-sell-by-date). Some of this packaging was marked as 'exclusive to Tesco' - I wonder how hard it is to get an exclusive distribution agreement with someone who doesn't exist?

As well as being on YouTube, Waitrose's live streaming is being shown at some of the UK's busiest train stations. Train delayed? Why not watch bees making honey for half an hour instead!

By showing the inner workings of their farm, Waitrose hope it will help highlight UK farming credentials while also showing off their sourcing policy in a new and contemporary manner.

Waitrose marketing director Rupert Thomas said of the campaign: "We’ve always been proud of where our food comes from, and the care and commitment our farmers and suppliers put into producing it. We have never compromised on quality, and never will - but rather than telling customers what we do, we’ve decided to show them in an open and honest way.”

And what better way to do that than strapping a Go-Pro to a cow.

## SOCIAL MEDIA: EU Against Humanity

The EU referendum is dominating the news agenda this week. The in and out campaigns finally got their official names ('Better Together' and 'Vote Leave'), and it's now just 10 weeks until Britain takes to the voting booths and decides whether to remain or remove itself from the European Union.

Twitter user [Jenny Owen](https://twitter.com/jenny_at_home) couldn't help but notice something rather familiar when she received a pro-EU leaflet through her letterbox. Clean design? Helvetica font? That looks like everyone's favourite politically incorrect game, *[Cards Against Humanity](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi83suR6JDMAhXJ1hQKHXNSAbQQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcardsagainsthumanity.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHo_nBfnzMG9KfjjuXWUMXqckYQdg&amp;sig2=OZ803jlsDLc0g7uYawWhDQ&amp;bvm=bv.119408272,d.bGg)*.

Naturally Jenny couldn't help but dig out CAH and put the two together, to great effect.
