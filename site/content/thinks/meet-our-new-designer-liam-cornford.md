We're delighted to unveil the latest addition to the Tomango team.

Please meet our new Designer, [Liam Cornford](/is/liam-cornford/).

Liam joined us on 30th April having previously worked at TinyBox in nearby Uckfield where he worked as an Artworker, Designer and Photographer.

He brings with him over 8 years' design and creative experience and has worked on various projects for a clients across the globe. We're delighted to have him joining us at Tomango.

After Liam’s first couple of weeks, I grabbed some time with him to ask him a few questions to get to know him a bit better;

### Hi Liam. Great to have you on the team. What’ve you made of your first couple of weeks?
It’s been great. It’s certainly been a sharp learning curve – I’ve had to learn fast about the different way you guys work here compared to previous jobs, but I’m loving it.

### In what way are we different?
I think the biggest difference has been in having and taking more time than I’ve had before to work on my designs and focusing much more on the quality end result rather than a quick turnaround.

### You came to Tomango from another design role, but have you always been a designer?
Not always, no. I worked for quite a long time in photography – advertising, commercial, product-based stuff.

So for quite a while I did photography and design alongside one another.

It’s only been in last four or five years that I’ve realised I wanted to be a designer. I still love photography, but I realised that being a self-employed photographer is hard work. Sometimes doing what you think is a “dream job” still means there are less glamourous parts of the role. Like admin. Not my strongest suit. I'm hoping there’ll be some opportunities to do quite a bit of photography here.

### What do you like to do when you're not at work - I hear you're a keen cyclist
Yeh, the rumour is true. The story goes that I used to play rugby and football a lot when I was younger, but I broke my leg playing rugby and had to have a couple of pins and a plate put in my leg which meant I couldn’t really run much without feeling quite a bit of pain.

I knew I needed to find a low-impact sport to keep fit and so I bought myself a mountain bike. I loved it but wanted go faster, so I bought a race bike and started riding to work and it went from there and now it’s became my real passion. It’s been good for me too; I used to be about 16 stone when I was playing rugby – I’m just under 13 stone now and feel much fitter. And happier.

### Now what's this rumour about you stealing a horse?
Ha! Yes, right. Let me explain about that;

Unfortunately, someone with the same name as me, and who lives in the same area as me, appears on Google when you type in my name. He happens to have a bit of a – shall we say – dodgy past. He stole a thoroughbred racehorse or something, which is ironic because my Dad works at Plumpton Racecourse. So as you can imagine, there has been some confusion from time to time…

I was about 22 when it happened and I was home from Uni and the police knocked on the door and asked to speak to me. Dad was like “What have you done?” but as soon as they mentioned the word “horse” my Dad said “there is NO way that’s my son – he can’t stand horses.”

This other Liam’s no relation or anything, but he’s only a couple of years older than me. It’s very strange and it plagues me to this day!

### If your house was on fire and you could save just one thing, what would you grab?
I’d have to say right now it would be my race bike. This is going to sound selfish, but it’s purely because when I get on the bike it’s my own space, it’s the chance to get to escape everything and get that headspace that you might need if you’ve had a challenging day. It’s just nice to get out and blow off some steam. So yes, it would have to be the bike.

### So when you’re on the bike, do you have to concentrate enough that you can’t think about much else, or does it actually provide good thinking time?
It depends – sometimes if I’m trying to hit a certain target, or climb a hill in a particular time, or something like that, then you’re focused and you don’t think about much else. But other times you might follow a route at a more leisurely pace and be able to take everything in, and then that’s a good time to take in your surroundings and you can have a think about things, if you want to.

### Do you have any hidden talents?
Erm. Hmmm, hidden talents…

I can eat very quickly…

Oh, I’m quite good at keepy-uppies. I used to continuously play football outside the house where I grew up – it was on the grounds of Plumpton Racecourse – kicking a ball against a wall, practising my keepy-uppies and volleys and that. My Dad might disagree with it being a hidden talent – I broke a lot of windows in his greenhouse.

A few weeks ago I was on a stag do and I was challenged to do some “skillz” and I found I can still do the keepy-uppies.

### We think you might have taken Tom's crown as the tallest person on the team - how tall are you?
We were talking about this the other day and Tom reckons he’s 191 cms and I’m 193 cms.

### That’s no good to me - what’s that in old money?
Well I’m 6ft 3 and Tom reckons he’s just under 6ft 2. He reckons I’m taller, but I reckon we’re about the same.

### An important one this - do you like Christmas?
Oh yes, I like Christmas. Probably more now than a few years ago. I have a young niece and nephew – they’re 5 and 3 – so having them around really helps keep the magic of Christmas. We have big family get-togethers now which is really nice. I’ve got a Christmas shirt - and jumper of course – if that’s some sort of indicator.

So there you go.

If you need someone to fix your bike, [Liam’s](/is/liam-cornford/) your man.

Just don’t ask him to look after your horse.
