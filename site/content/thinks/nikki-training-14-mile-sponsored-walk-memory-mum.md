On 10th September, our [Head of Finance Nikki Carrick](/is/nikki-carrick/) will be walking 14 miles across London in memory of her Mum Cathy, and to raise money for the Stroke Assocation.

Nikki and her sister Fran will be taking part in the [Thames Bridges Trek](http://www.thamespathchallenge.com/thames-bridges-trek), joining around 1,000 others in walking across the capital, taking in 16 of its finest bridges in the process.

Setting out from Putney Bridge, they head east towards the city, zig-zagging over an array of historic bridges - including Westminster, Waterloo and the Millenium Bridge - finishing 23km later in Southwark after crossing Tower Bridge.

Nikki and Fran are raising money for the [Stroke Association](https://www.stroke.org.uk/), and are walking in memory of their Mum Cathy, who died suddenly in June last year from a stroke. She was 79.

"After losing our Mum so suddenly last year, we really wanted to do something to raise money for the Stroke Association", said Nikki.

"They need donations to help people who've had strokes, and to help research how to stop this dreadful thing happening to other people. My Mum was a very fit and healthy 79 when she died - she would go into town shopping every day, famously bustling around looking for bargains - so this can happen to anyone, at any time."

The sisters are walking under their team name The Sparkly Girls. Nikki explains;

"It was a tradition with Mum that whenever we got together on special occasions - Christmas, Birthdays, or even just Sunday lunch - we'd start with a glass of sparkly, and it's one of the things I'll always associate with her!"

The girls are hoping to raise as much money as they can for this worthwhile cause. If you'd like to help, you can [donate through their JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/Fran-Nikki-Carrick).

"Our initial target's Â£300, and we're already well on our way, but it would be great if we could raise even more. I hope as many people as possible can help!"
