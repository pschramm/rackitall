The BBC news team has rolled out a new mobile-friendly design into beta this month. With broad strokes of minimalism and a simplified colour palette, the new site is quite a large step away from their current design.

## Header

The header section of the site has taken on the most obvious change, many items have been dropped from the main navigation, the sub-navigation has been removed from below the main navigation bar and the top navigation section has been slimmed down and converted to a more subtle white backed section with the inverted BBC logo.

Other changes include dropping the globe graphic and RSS feed link, the scrolling news slider has gone and the ellipsis after the top navigation link ‘More’ has been swapped for a more obvious ‘navigational’ arrow.

The header works really well on a mobile device with the top navigation being shrunk to only contain two links and the ‘More’ sub-navigation. The search and sign-in icons have also been slimmed down considerably. The main navigation is minified to the almost industry standard ‘hamburger’ but interestingly, is named ‘Sections’ rather than the usual ‘Menu’. This certainly helps to keep the site feeling journalistic.

## Home page

Each article snippet has been considerably simplified showing only a title, an image, an excerpt, a timestamp and a region. All links to related articles and videos have been moved to inside the main article, a simple clock icon has been added along with the new timestamp feature and a 1 pixel line breaks apart each article. The cleanliness of the design is a little striking when compared side-by-side but it is incredibly easy to read and use.

The right hand sidebar has been hugely simplified with larger images and copy, fewer colours all contained in a clear container. The Watch/Listen section has been moved to the bottom of the page along with the sports headlines and weather search.

## Article

The standard article view is mostly unchanged with bolder headings and slightly larger body copy being the main change. The clarity of the new header is very obvious on this view.

## Complex Article

A more complex article shows some more sidebar changes and simplifications, this time in the form of a rather stylish author twitter feed. Although there is still a reasonable amount of content in the sidebar, there are no images or related articles. This more focused approach stops distraction from the sidebar and helps promote the main content area. The author bar has been stripped back to the bare minimum and the share icons have been dropped altogether from the top of the page. One notable new feature is the more user-friendly timestamp. 'Last updated at 17:00' may be more accurate but the simpler '3 hours ago' is a much nicer way of displaying this data.

## In Conclusion

The site feels very mobile-friendly, almost too friendly in my opinion. It’s always difficult when working in a mobile-friendly environment to balance depth of information and simplicity for smaller screens and it feels like the site leans slightly too much towards the simplistic approach which for a news site is a somewhat adventurous decision.

All-in-all though, the update is very welcome. Although somewhat radical at first glance, the beta redesign is very classy and simple. It drags the current, slightly dated design well into the twenty-first century. The subtle typography updates, the simplified home page and the overhauled header section are great improvements and I look forward to them being implemented in the future to the live site.
