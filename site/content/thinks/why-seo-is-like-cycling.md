In a [previous post](/thinks/local-seo-a-brief-guide/) I dropped an analogy at the end likening the practice of search engine optimisation to that of top-level cycling.

No, not that those who do it do so with a helping hand from a range of performance enhancing drugs...it was actually to do with the philosophy of David Brailsford, former performance director of British Cycling and now manager of the very successful Team Sky:

> "The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improved it by 1%, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together."

This is known as the *[aggregation of marginal gains](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34247629). *The notion that, by improving a whole host of things by the smallest of margins, you'll get a huge bump in results. Tiny little things, like teaching the British cyclists how to [wash their hands properly](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/19174302),  or re-jigging the team bus to make it more comfy. Do enough of them and you're cooking with gas - over the past few years this has led to 16 Olympic gold medals and three of the last four Tour de France titles.

How's this like SEO, I hear you ask?

Well, search engines sort their results using algorithms that have hundreds of factors. The precise amount is unknown - but it could be anywhere from [200](http://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors) to a massive [10,000](http://searchengineland.com/bing-10000-ranking-signals-google-55473).

So if you've given yourself a pat on the back because you've written one blog post this month, don't be so sure of yourself. There's *plenty* more you could be doing.

The above 'Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors' from [Search Engine Land](http://searchengineland.com/) gives you some of key ranking factors for both on-page and off-page search engine.

Simply put, focusing on just a handful of factors and expecting your organic search performance to sky-rocket is plain naïve. What you need to do is be aware of as many as possible; constantly tweaking and refining your approach to try and squeeze out that extra bit of performance.
