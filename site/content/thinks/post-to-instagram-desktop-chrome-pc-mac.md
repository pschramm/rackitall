As someone that takes runs [social media marketing](/creates/online-marketing/social-media/) efforts for a number of accounts across a variety of platforms, I always like finding ways of making the administrative side a bit easier.

One particular bugbear of mine has been with Instagram. As a rule, Instagram is quite ‘locked down’ compared to Facebook, Twitter and suchlike – for example, there’s little-to-no API access, meaning scheduling posts can be difficult.

Another thing I’ve found a bit of pain was that, although you can view your Instagram feed on desktop (although Instagram Stories was only a recent addition to this), actually posting images from non-mobile devices is a PITA.

I’ve actually dabbled with bits of software that mimic a mobile environment before – Gramblr being one that got used for all of five minutes – but it turns out there’s a much better, cheaper and simpler way around it!

## How to post to Instagram from Google Chrome

- Step one – download [Google Chrome!](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Step two – once you’ve downloaded and installed Google Chrome, open it, go to [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/), and log in to your account.
- Step three – open **Chrome Developer Tools** (Ctrl+Shift+J, or Cmd+Option+J on Mac).
- Step four – once that’s done, press Ctrl+Shift+M to go to **Mobile View**.At this stage, you should see something like in the image below.Should you wish, you can even choose which mobile device to replicate the viewport of (we’ve gone for the iPhone X).

- Step five – **post your image!** As you can see from the screengrab, the ‘add image’ icon is right there at the bottom of the screen, just as it is on your phone or tablet.

Clicking upon it will open up your PC or Mac file manager, where you can navigate to your chosen image.

- Step six – enjoy the time you’ve saved!

Not bad at all!
