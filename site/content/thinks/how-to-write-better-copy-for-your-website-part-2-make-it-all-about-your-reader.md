"Hello, I'm Steve, and I give my customers their weekends back."

With his opening gambit, this guy had my attention. And he was the only person I'd met that morning who really had.

## The exhausting pastime of speed networking

Have you ever been speed networking? It's like speed dating, but for businesses.

Around 50 nervous-looking people get split into two groups, with one half stationed at tables scattered around a hotel conference room, and the other half are on the move, spending two minutes talking to each new "partner" before a whistle blows (I kid you not), and moving on to their next potential new-best-friend.

I found the whole process exhausting, and haven't tried it a second time. I expect I've still got the business cards I collected that morning in the bottom of a drawer somewhere, but I don't think I can recall anyone I met.

Except Steve.

## Find out why your customers love you

Steve's a gardener. He cuts grass, pulls weeds, and plants and waters stuff to make his customer's gardens look good.

What he'd done (the clever sod) was to understand exactly what he did for his customers that they loved so much.

He knows that most of his clients are perfectly capable of looking after their gardens themselves, but they're busy people trying to cram in loads of other stuff into already packed weekends.

By working this out, and telling a very compelling story, he got my attention.

As a way of marketing his business, it's pure gold magic fairy dust. And I tell you, Steve's doing very well indeed, thank you.

## Make your website copy all about the reader

In this second post of a series on [How To Write Better Copy For Your Website](/thinks/how-to-write-better-copy-for-your-website-part-1-writing-for-a-lower-reading-age/), we look at why you have to make your copy all about your reader.

In the last couple of years I've been doing a lot of research into web copy, and recently came across this gem of a post from the always-excellent DTelepathy:

[Read: How To Design A Landing Page That Turns Visitors Into Customers](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/design/how-to-design-a-landing-page-that-turns-visitors-into-customers)

What this post explains is that you've got less than 5 seconds to tell your visitors your main marketing message, and that message needs to say "What's the single value proposition we want to transmit to our potential customers?"

## How your customers think

Here's the brutal truth: Your customer doesn't care about you. He cares about himself.

He wants to know what's in it for him. What does he get from buying something from you?

You've only got a few seconds remember, so your message needs to hit him right between the eyes and connect with him on some emotional level.

You have to make it easy for him to *get it*.

Consider and compare the following messages and consider how you would react to them as a customer:

- "Our software enables you to combine your tasks and email management to improve productivity"
- "Software for you to get more done at work"


They both get to the same point, but which one gets your attention?

## Put yourself in your customer's shoes

When you're reviewing your copy, take your business hat off and - to mix my clothing metaphors - put yourself in your customer's shoes.

Make it all about them:

- What's the single, "distilled" benefit to them?
- What's the pain they feel that you can make go away?
- What's the solution you provide to them?


*Don't *make it all about what you do, or how clever you are.

## Getting started - list your benefits

Start by making a list of the benefits of your product/service/whatever. Not the features, the *benefits*. Why would your customer buy from you?

Steve's list of benefits for his lawn-cutting service might have looked something like this:

- You get a nice looking lawn
- It's regularly looked after
- Someone else does it for you



## Find your inner child

Once you've got your list, you need to distill the benefits into a single, compelling message.

One way of doing this is to pretend you're two years old and keep repeatedly asking "But, why?"

![](images/blog/child-asking-why.jpg "Keep asking "but, why?")

Take point 3 from our list above - "Someone else does it for you". OK, but why is this a benefit? What does the customer get?

The answer might be: "Because it takes time to mow the lawn and it's a pain in the arse to do it every week - my customer has enough to do at the weekend, so by me doing it, I'm helping him out."

Why is that a benefit - what does your customer get?

"He gets more free time - and free time is precious. He gets his weekend back."

Bingo.

## *The power of the words "You" and "Your"*

So connecting with your customers is the key to getting their interest. You can make that connection stronger by using certain words in your copy.

Here's a great free tool for experimenting with your copy to make it connect with your reader more emotionally by scoring a high [Emotional Marketing Value](http://www.aminstitute.com/headline/).

Go on, I challenge you - try it and see the highest score you can get.

You might have discovered that using the words "you" or "your" help boost your score. Research has shown that these words quickly establish a connection to your reader. This might seem obvious, but it's easy to miss.

## How I re-wrote the headings on the new Tomango website

Let me show you how I applied this to some of the headings on the new Tomango site.

Here's the original sub-headline idea I had for the [Web Development](/creates/web/) page:

![](images/blog/web-development-headline-original.jpeg "The original heading was rather self-centred and all about me, me, me...")

After going through the acting-like-a-two-year-old process, I distilled the message to highlight the benefits:

![](images/blog/web-development-headline-edited.jpeg "The tweaked headline is all about the reader. Note the use of "you" and "your".")

Now take a look at your heading. Can you make it better?

Try it, then compare your new heading with the old one.

Then try and make it better still. Make a list of possible versions and pick the best one.

## Checklist: How to make your copy better


- Look throughout your copy for instances where you've said "we" and change it for a "you".
- Look for where you've used "our" and change it for "your".
- Drill down to the real benefit and distill it into a single, *strong* marketing message.



## Conclusion

By making these tweaks to your online copy, you'll connect with your reader in ways you hadn't even thought of - and turn them into your next customer.

If you need some help, that's what we're here for.

And if you need someone to look after your garden, speak to Steve...
