Following on from the announcement of the arrival of Tomango in our previous blog post, we are now able to reveal the new brand identity for the company.

![](images/blog/brand-identity.jpg "The final brand identity design.")

In this post, we wanted to take the opportunity to not only show you the final brand identity design, but also to describe in detail the process we followed to achieve the end result. This is the same process that we follow for our clients, so we thought it might be interesting for you to see behind the scenes of how a new [brand identity](/creates/brand/) is developed.

## The brief

Before we started, we created a design brief. We had already established what our “brand values” are and, of course, had selected a name.

Our brand is about quality, knowledge, experience and reliability but also fun and creativity. We wanted to create an identity that fitted these brand values and we frequently referred back to the brief during the design process.

## The process


### 1. The initial concept

We started by looking at some basic concepts for the graphic device.

Our starting point for this idea was the two main areas of our business; online and offline design. Our range of skills enable us to effectively manage where these overlap, ensuring our clients get the very best end result.

This basic Venn-style diagram represents where these two areas join and got us thinking about a shape that could be used for the brand's graphic device.

### 2. Establishing the shape of the graphic device

We liked the idea of developing a Tomango "t" and here you can see how the circles were worked up to resemble this outline shape.

![](images/blog/brand-identity-4.jpg "The “t” was developed by colouring a section of the overlapping circles.")

In this image you can see how the two overlapping circles have had some of their shaded area removed to created the stylised "t" shape.

However, there was one element of this idea that we didn't like. We felt that the shape was a bit harsh, and our brand is about being friendly and approachable. We needed to find a way of softening the logo to fit the brief.

### 3. The final shape of the graphic device

Our design team worked on the graphic device further and rounded off the edges at the top of the "t" and at the bottom of the tail.

In this image, you can see how the final image looks with the edges softened.

We were happy with the graphic device and again, referring back to the brief we felt it fitted what were trying to achieve, so next we moved on to the verbal elements of the brand - in particular the font size and style.

### 4. Choosing the font

Our design team spent a long time researching different fonts that might be suitable for the verbal elements of the brand.

After a shortlisting process and much discussion (!), we chose a font called Kievit Pro.

![](images/blog/brand-identity-8.jpg "Various fonts were researched before selecting Kievit Pro.")

We felt this font matched our brief to be professional and "grown-up", but personal, friendly and approachable. Again, we needed to round off the corners to soften it up a bit and in the image on the right you can see the final font.

### 5. Combining the verbal and graphic elements

We had created our graphic device. We had selected, amended and finalised our font. Now we needed to combine the two.

![](images/blog/brand-identity-9.jpg "At this stage, we combined the verbal element of the logo with the graphic device.")

It was important to get the position and overall balance between font and logo right.

We opted to place the graphic device top-right of the name. We felt this gave the overall logo a good balance, with slight emphasis on the name rather than the logo.

We also rather liked the connotations with a mathematical symbol.

### 6. Size

At this point, we wanted to make sure that the brand identity would work at different sizes. The logo could be used in a wide range of circumstances, from stationery to signage, so it's vital that we know it works in all cases.

![](images/blog/brand-identity-10.jpg "We wanted to be sure that the logo would work in a variety of sizes.")

We were very happy with the impact of the brand at both ends of the scale. Better to find this out now than further down the line...

We have seen many cases of clients that have brands developed that look great on stationery, but not very good on signs - or vice versa. It is important to make sure this is investigated in the development stage.

### 7. Colour

We wanted a colour that was fresh, fun and vibrant and that was also warm and friendly. The obvious colour was perhaps orange - because a Tomango is a variety of orange - but we thought this was a bit obvious.

![](images/blog/brand-identity-12.jpg "We selected a warm and vibrant red as the colour for the graphic device and a dark grey for the font.")

Despite some initial reservations from certain members of the team (ok - me), we agreed that red was ideal. We looked at various shades and plumped for a slightly pink shade rather than a real deep scarlet, which we felt was a bit harsh.

We also wanted to go for a dark grey rather than black for the name, again to soften the overall impression of the brand.

### 8. The final brand identity

And here it is - the final brand identity design for Tomango.

We're delighted with the results and the brand looks fantastic on the new website (which we'll be launching in the New Year), our signage and stationery.
