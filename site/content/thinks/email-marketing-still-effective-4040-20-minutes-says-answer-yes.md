Here's some hard evidence that email marketing works and can bring you a significant return on your investment.

A few weeks ago I spent about 20 minutes composing and sending our monthly email out to our clients. This simple bit of marketing immediately generated *£4,040 of sales*.  Let me tell you how I did it...

Every month I write a couple of blog posts for the Tomango website, usually about a particular area of our business that I think might be of interest to either our clients or prospective customers looking for a [brand](/creates/brand/) and web agency like ours.  It's a perfect way of demonstrating our expertise and engaging our audience.

> Email marketing is extremely cost-effective and delivers outstanding ROI

Towards the end of the month, I put together our regular marketing email that typically contains:

- A short version of one of the blog posts, with a link to the full article
- A couple of projects we've recently started or won
- A recently completed project from our portfolio


Using our beautifully designed HTML email template and the [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com) email platform, I put together [this marketing email](http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=794f167815307066804ef6873&amp;id=a1a1cbe3dd&amp;e=e4c48256cd) at the end of June.

The blog post I linked to was called "How we saved our client £1,000s and boosted its turnover by 15%" and was about how important it is to put together a cohenrent and effective online marketing campaign.

I imported a list of our client's email addresses from our CRM system, did a couple of tests to soothe my paranoia and 10 minutes later, the email landed in our clients' inboxes.

## Here's what happened next

As well as receiving a few polite thank yous and how-are-you-old-chaps, we also had orders for:

- 2 requests for website updates
- 1 client wanting us to take on their online marketing for six months
- 1 request for an HTML email template ("just like yours please")



> 20 minutes work.  Total sales = £4,040.  Thank you very much...
