How can a strong [brand identity](/creates/brand/) set you apart from your competitors and win you more business?  Take a look at the work we've recently done for Agon Systems and see for yourself.

## Background &amp; history

[Agon Systems](/created/agon-systems/) is a manufacturer of Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) equipment based near Biel, in Switzerland.

You've probably seen and walked past EAS equipment hundreds of times in your life; thousands if you're a keen shopper.

You know the security tags you find attached to clothing and other items in shops - the ones that set off an alarm if they're not taken off before you leave the store?  Agon makes the release systems for the tags and the head-height pedestals you walk past at the shop entrance.

The company has recently been bought by our client, Sean Welch, from the original owners that founded Agon in 1996.

## The old brand

Agon has a deserved reputation for building products of exceptional quality and reliability.

Their ongoing support and customer service is excellent and they epitomise the values one tends to associate with the phrase "Swiss-made".  As a result, in its previous 18 years Agon has got its business almost exclusively through word-of-mouth and reputation.

The brand identity that Sean inherited was virtually untouched since the company first started.

It was agreed that the brand looked dated and didn't fit the values and reputation that Agon has cultivated.  The bevelled edges and washed out colours had not aged well and the overall impression was of a business that didn't take care over its image.

## The brief

Sean's business goals are to increase the company's European distributor base, help the existing distributors to raise their profiles, to land a handful of large, direct retail clients and to double turnover.  In order to achieve this, Sean realises that the brand identity needs to reflect the values of the business and position them correctly in their marketplace.  This would help them to differentiate from competitors and give potential customers a clear reason to chose Agon over its rivals.

Agon is also an innovative organisation.  It is the only company that can supply a revolutionary new security tag (the "Concept tag") and it's the only manufacturer that can design bespoke pedestals; so a retailer can have its own uniquely designed pedestal to fit seamlessly with its brand identity and store interior.

## The new brand

Our designers created a bespoke typeface for the new brand, based on a circular structure which reflects the global nature of the business.   The font is modern, confident and high-end.

The brief clearly stated that the brand should be obviously, instantly-recognisable as "Swiss-made" and should retain the Swiss flag.  The graphic device follows this, but fits in with the circular structure of the typeface.

The new brand identity fits the brief perfectly, and captures the brand values of the company:

- High quality
- Knowledgeable
- Swiss-made
- Professional
- Confident



## The result

When you look at Agon's new brand alongside those of its competitors, you can see how it positions them at the top end of the marketplace.

When rolling out the brand identity across business stationery, the website and other marketing collateral, great care is taken on details like copy, photography and the quality of materials used in printing.

This ensures Agon gives out a consistent brand message and this, in turn, helps them charge more for their premium products and services.
