### Just £10 can make a difference to someone's Christmas

This blog post has proven to be pretty popular. Over 1,500 people read it yesterday.

It's full of facts, including stuff about the amount of money we spend and food we eat at Christmas.

It made me stop and think that for many people, Christmas isn't great fun at all.

It's actually a bit shit.

Over 14 million people in the UK are living in poverty. If you live in the UK, that means the chances are there are people in your town, maybe even in your street, who are struggling to make ends meet.

Could you spare £10 to give someone a decent Christmas?

Thanks, and Merry Christmas!

## Christmas traditions and origins

1. Christmas is a contraction of “Christ’s Mass,” which is derived from the Middle English Cristemasse, which in turn comes from the Old English Cristesmæsse, a phrase first recorded waa-aay back in 1038.

2. Hanging stockings out comes from the Dutch custom of leaving shoes packed with food for St Nicholas's donkeys. He would leave small gifts in return.

3. The tradition of putting tangerines in stockings comes from 12th-century French nuns who left socks full of fruit, nuts and tangerines at the houses of the poor.

4. Boxing Day gets its name from all the money collected in church alms-boxes for the poor.

5. The first commercial Christmas cards were commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843. Featuring a family drinking wine, one sold for £8,469 in 2014.

6. Robins on cards started as a joke 150 years ago when postmen wore red tunics and were named after them.

7. The christmas cracker was invented by a London sweet shop owner called Tom Smith. In 1847, after spotting French bonbons wrapped in paper with a twist at each end, he sold similar sweets with a “love motto” inside. He then included a little trinket and a “bang”. His "Bangs of Expectation" included gifts such as jewellery and miniature dolls. By 1900, he was selling 13 million a year.

8. According to tradition, you should eat one mince pie on each of the 12 days of Christmas to bring good luck.

9. It's technically illegal to eat mince pies on Christmas Day in England. In the 17th century, Oliver Cromwell banned Christmas pudding, mince pies and anything to do with gluttony. The law has never been rescinded.

10. Why red, gold and green? Green has long been a symbol of life and rebirth; red symbolizes the blood of Christ, and gold represents light as well as wealth and royalty.

11. Mistletoe (Viscum album) is from the Anglo-Saxon word misteltan, which means “little dung twig” because the plant spreads though bird droppings.

![](images/blog/cliff-christmas.jpg "Chriiist-mas tiiime, little dung twig and wine...")

12. Santa hasn't always dressed in red. Pre 1930s there were many different variations of Santa, sporting a variety of different coloured garments and ranging in size from big to small. Some people claim the modern day image of Santa Claus was created by Coca-Cola, but this isn't strictly true. The original red-suited Santa became popular in the US and Canada in the 19th century due to the influence of caricaturist and cartoonist Thomas Nast. Coca-Cola commissioned their depiction of Santa in 1931.

13. Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer was invented for a US firm's Christmas promotion in 1938.

14. The Yule Log was originally an entire tree that was carefully chosen and brought into the house with great ceremony and burned over the 12 days of Christmas.  A Chocolate Yule Log or 'bûche de Noël' is now a popular Christmas desert, made of a chocolate sponge roll layered with cream. The outside is covered with chocolate or chocolate icing and decorated to look like a bark-covered log.

![](images/blog/yule-log.jpg)

15. Traditionally, families gather together in the kitchen of their homes to mix and steam Christmas pudding on Stir-up Sunday, the last Sunday before Advent. Everyone takes a turn to stir the pudding mix and make a special wish for the year ahead.

16. Holly and Ivy have been used to decorate homes since the 9th century because they symbolise everlasting life. The holly represents Christ’s crown of thorns and the berries his blood.

17. The word "Carol" actually means dance or song of praise and joy, and they used to be sung during all four seasons, but the tradition of only singing them at Christmas is the only one to survive.

## Christmas facts in numbers

18. US scientists calculated that Santa would have to visit 822 homes a second to deliver all the world's presents on Christmas Eve, travelling at 650 miles a second.

19. The origins of there being Three Wise Men aren't clear. There's certainly no mention of it in the bible - in the Gospel of Matthew it refers to just "wise men".

20. The chances of a White Christmas are just 1 in 10 for England and Wales, and 1 in 6 for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

21. *16* - The average number of Christmas presents a UK child receives.

22. *6 million* - The number of rolls of sellotape that will be sold in the UK in the run up to Christmas (5.99 million - the number of rolls where you can't find where the tape ends).

24. *27%* of families sit down to watch the Queen's Speech.

26. According to Matalan, 82% of people surveyed own a Christmas jumper, with 25-34 year olds the most likely to buy one. Over 75% of people buy their festive jumper to wear for a work event, whilst over half wear one on Christmas Day.

![](images/blog/christmas-jumpers.jpg "Christmas jumpers - no matter how hard you try, they're just never going to be cool.")
