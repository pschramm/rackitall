With the new website now live, we continued the brand rollout for the Concept Tag with the creation of a new brochure.

The brochure was created to promote the [Concept Tag](http://www.concepttag.com/); the “World’s most secure EAS Tag”. This revolutionary new product from [Agon Systems](http://www.agon-systems.com/) eliminates illicit tag removal and is proven to reduce losses by 66%.

By obtaining a detailed brief from the client it became clear the brochure had to reinforce the key values of the product; quality, reliability and durability. This was achieved by the use of strong typography, engaging copy, high impact images and the final print finish.

It was agreed the brochure was going to be finished in a matte lamination.  Lamination adds a layer of protective coating to the printed surface whilst also improving its sturdiness and water resistance. Lamination also has the added benefit of improving the tactile feel of the printed surface, lending it a smooth finish.  Matte lamination creates a very luxurious and elegant finish to any printed materials.

Another crucial aspect of creating a quality experience for the recipient is the density of the paper. Paper density refers to the thickness of the paper stock and is measured in GSM (grams per square metre). Due to the high quality look and feel we wanted, we decided on using a board thickness of 350 GSM.

To ensure the best possible finish was achieved we not only designed the brochure but also created the copy, art directed the photo shoot and managed the printing. This ensured the highest quality of all the elements we needed to bring together to deliver such a great result.

This is just one of the items of marketing collateral we’ve created for Agon Systems. Other items include stationery, product sheets, leaflets, signage, artwork for exhibition stands just to name a few.
