The way we interact with the web is changing fast. We browse on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops; even [watches are getting smarter](https://getpebble.com/). It’s only natural that the content we publish and the way it is displayed should develop at the same rate. Unfortunately that’s not the case with many websites. Older sites (and sadly an alarming number of new websites) struggle to keep pace with the number of devices that view them; they just can’t adapt on a device by device basis. Adaption is what responsive design is all about.

> Responsive design ensures your website is displayed in its optimum form on *any *device.

By adapting to each specific device, a website can alter how it looks and functions to best suit the user.

## So why do I need it?

The simple answer is usability. If the user has to zoom, scroll horizontally, or rotate the screen to navigate the website, they’ll need a pretty good reason to stay. A fixed-width website is a huge usability barrier when browsing on a mobile device. If the user has to choose between a difficult-to-navigate fixed-width site and an alternative easy-to-use responsive site - the decision isn’t a hard one.

The statistics speak for themselves. John Lewis recently announced that “42% of their online traffic now comes from smartphones and tablets” and they have “seen mobile orders more than double on a year ago” <cite>[BBC Article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25175755).</cite> Below is a comparison of the [John Lewis](http://johnlewis.com) website on a mobile device - one with mobile-friendly styling, one as fixed-width.

It’s easy to see why there has been such a jump in mobile orders and traffic when you compare the sites side-by-side. The mobile site looks like real care has been put into the way it looks and works and it’s a joy to use. The fixed-width site on the mobile screen looks like a real hassle to navigate, let alone buy products through it.

## Mobile site vs Responsive Design

There are two common approaches when creating a mobile-friendly website:

*1. Develop two websites, one for mobile phones and small tablets, one for desktops and large tablets.*

A separate mobile site will be fully tailored to a mobile device and could host completely different content to the desktop site. Although a mobile website gives you more control on what mobile users should see, it often means more upkeep and potentially twice the amount of work when running updates. And whilst it's easier to develop alongside an existing website, with the lines between sizes of smartphones and tablets becoming increasingly blurred there's a dangerous lack of future-proofing.

The [John Lewis](http://www.johnlewis.com/) website shown above is a fixed-width site with a separate mobile specific website.

*2. Develop one website that reacts to all devices.*

A single responsive website will show the same content on all devices but the way the content is displayed will be matched perfectly to the device. Updates on content and code are made in one central place which reduces ongoing costs and ensures consistency. Server space is also cut in half compared to a separate mobile website.

[Change Formation](http://www.changeformation.co.uk/) is a responsive website that we've recently developed. Try resizing the browser window to see it adapt to your screen.

#### Considerations

An argument often voiced when discussing mobile usability is the “dumbing down” of information. As the screen size is smaller than a desktop, it is often convenient to drop sections of information for mobile users. If you're not careful, a separate mobile site could lead to this issue. The best way to avoid the simplification of data is to assess the element you're planning on dropping and asking the question "If the mobile user doesn't need to see this, does the desktop user?" You may find that the element is unnecessary on all devices, in which case it could be dropped from the site altogether.

#### Our opinion

We feel that a single responsive website is by far the better option of the two; it gives you great control, reduced ongoing costs and a single place to run updates.
