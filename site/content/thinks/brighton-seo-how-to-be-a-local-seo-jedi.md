I had my first experience of the amazing [Brighton SEO](http://brightonseo.com) conference on Friday – seeing as how I've lived down the road from Brighton most of my life, it’s pretty poor form that I'd never been to the event before...

The day proved to be incredibly valuable on the whole and the Brighton Dome was absolutely packed with digital marketers from all over the UK and beyond. In fact, there were so many it was announced on the day that the next edition will take place at the much larger Brighton Centre.

## The day before...

But before the full conference kicked off on Friday I was lucky enough to get down to the Dome the day before for a great session on Local SEO from [Greg Gifford](https://twitter.com/GregGifford), who had come all the way from Texas to share his knowledge and expertise.

Greg is the Director of Search and Social at [DealerOn](http://www.dealeron.com/), a software company that provides websites and online marketing to new car dealers all over the USA. He's got over 14 years of experience, and his expertise helped hundreds of car dealers thrive while the industry struggled during the recession.

Greg's workshop was a six-hour salvo of the ins and outs of local SEO, set to a slide deck (linked below) full to the brim with Star Wars references - with heavy use of force lightning to highlight the 'shocking' aspects.

## Defining local SEO

In Greg's words, Local SEO is "the process of using tracking signals both on- and off-site to enhance the local relevance of that site in Google’s eyes. Your efforts are designed to prove that that website should be a relevant result when someone is targeting specific searches in your geographic area”.

A great way to explain this to clients, Greg said, was to use ‘pizza delivery’ as an example. If you’re at work and search for the term ‘pizza delivery’, you'll have a different set of results come up than if you did it at home…Google knows where you are and can change the search engine results based on that. He expands on this metaphor in [this blog post](http://searchengineland.com/need-help-explaining-local-search-use-pizza-227448).

Your website's content is the most important signal for ranking well on search engines. You need to make sure that it's simple to digest, useful for your audience, and as unique as it can be. It's a myth that duplicate content will be penalised, but it *is* true that *unique* content will be given a ranking boost.

If you’re not sure if a piece of content will be good for your site, just think – would you be happy going into Google HQ and confidently explaining to them why it has a place on your website? If you wouldn’t be, it’s probably not right.

## Local links

Local link building is also valuable. Are there any bloggers in your area? Can you get an article (and link) syndicated across local online news titles? Can you sponsor a local event or meeting? Or do you or your clients have existing relationships that could be used to good advantage?

When you sit down and think about it, there will be plenty of opportunities to increase the flow of your local link levels. All of these will indicate that your local area trusts you, and you'll increase your relevance for local searches.

And remember, no-follow links don't necessarily matter for local SEO, so don't shy away from an opportunity if this is your only reason not to do it. The [Domain Authority](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority) of such sites isn't critical either.

## Find the local angle to your content

Finally, and probably the biggest takeaway from Greg’s session – it’s all very well writing content relevant to your business area, but the other side of the coin is writing content relevant to your *geographic* area. If you're trying to get your website to have a strong local SEO presence, *make your blog a local resource!*

You could interview a local celebrity, preview an upcoming event, or pen a 'top 5 places to eat'...free information and no-strings-attached help can go a long way to establishing trust in your brand, so keep at it and you'll find those living nearby noticing *your *website as a great hub for local content.
