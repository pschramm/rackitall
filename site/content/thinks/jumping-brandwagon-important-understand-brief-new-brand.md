This week, following a swift u-turn after a fans' backlash, Everton Football Club launched its [NEW new brand identity](http://www.evertonfc.com/news/yournextevertoncrest).  This is the latest example in the last few months of a high profile company re-brand that has drawn criticism from both the design community and the brand's own customers.

But it's not right to just dismiss a new brand without knowing the *brief*.  How can you judge the success of a rebrand if you don't know what it's trying to achieve?  In this article, we look at some recent high-profile rebrands that have been poorly received and consider whether Everton's marketing team deserved the stick they got.

## ITV &amp; Yahoo

Back in January, ITV unveiled their new brand and got __slated__ for it.  The criticism seemed to be rather non-specific though.  "I just don't like it", "It looks amateurish", "My daughter/son/nephew could have done better".  Fact-based criticism was certiainly thin on the ground.  Last month, it was Yahoo's turn and they got a bit of a mixed reception too but again, you had to look quite hard for someone that could back up their disapproval with evidence that the design didn't fit the brief.

## Everton Football Club

In May, Everton FC unveiled a new club crest - and immediately felt the full wrath of thousands of fans who were outraged at the rebrand, labelling it (amongst other things) "clownish", "amateurish" and "embarrassing".  Much of the fans ire was caused by the removal of certain historical and traditional elements of the crest, and they felt that the club's proud heritage was being diminished.  The existing club crest had been in use since 2000 and has had [nine different predecessors](http://www.evertonfc.com/history/history-of-the-club-crest.html) dating back to 1920, with elements appearing and then disappearing again, so you could be forgiven for thinking it wasn't that big a deal.  But football fans are a passionate lot, and Everton had a problem on their hands.

Over 20,000 people signed an online petition within 24 hours of the announcement, demanding that it be withdrawn - but it was too late.  Merchandise had already been ordered with the new crest and other marketing material was already in production.  Everton acted swiftly though and took the opportunity to liaise with fans, assuring them that, although they couldn't do anything about the crest this year, a new crest would be developed and voted for in time for next season.

### How bad was the new crest?

Here's the new design that was met with such vitriol.  Alongside it is the previous crest that was used between 2000 and this year.  Criticism appeared to focus on a few particular points:

- The "fattened arse" of the shield
- The inclusion of the word "Everton" - which probably resulted in point 1
- The fattened and distorted Prince Rupert's Tower in the middle - a symbol used by the club as far back as 1938
- The removal of the club motto "Nil Satis Nisi Optimum", which translates as "Nothing but the best is good enough"



### So why did it all go wrong?

The main problem Everton created with the whole process was in not explaining to the fans why they needed or wanted to change the crest in the first place and what the reasons were behind it.  They didn't share the *design brief* with their supporters, so no-one understood the logic behind the chosen design.  This resulted in the rather inevitable "that's rubbish, is that" reaction.

### Everton's brief

Today was the first time that I saw the key points of the brief spelt out - unfortunately not by the club but by an in-the-know fan - who pointed out why a new crest was needed and what it had to achieve:

- It's about how/where it can be used and how easy it is for people to get it wrong
- Once you accept that your brand needs to be consistent, the obvious way to go is to have a consistent logo
- The previous (old) one was unnecessarily complex - many elements were easy to remove, people could stress different elements of it and it didn't contain the name of the brand
- Everton aren't at the level of Nike, Pepsi, Apple etc and the marketing team wanted to push the name
- The main issue with the complexity is what happens when it's resized.  The logo has to work at all sorts of sizes, from [on the side of the stadium](http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/29012011/8/photo/view-welcome-sign-outside-goodison-park.html) right down to [tiny little website badges](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs.html).  The old crest would have looked poor in that context - see the likes of Newcastle, Liverpool, Hull or Southampton as evidence
- For merchandise, it's far easier to reproduce a simple integrated design that something with a raft of floating elements



### How about the NEW new crest?

Here's the redesigned crest that was unveiled today.  Most fans seem to be happier with this, but I bet the problem wouldn't have been anywhere near as bad if the brief had been shared with the supporters when the first one was designed.  Still, Everton get to demonstrate that they care about and listen to their fanbase, and get some extra publicity for the new crest - so that's all good, then.

## Creating a brief for your brand

Why is this relevant to our clients?  Because it highlights the importance of creating a well-considered brief that:

- * Fits your brand values* - it conveys the message about you that you want to portray
- *Works for your target markets* - if your customers are wealthy individuals, your brand should appeal to them
- *Fits your business model* - if you pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap, your brand shouldn't be like Aston Martin
