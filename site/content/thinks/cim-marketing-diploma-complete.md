There's a reason why a few of my blog posts for Tomango have been rather theory-based bits and pieces regarding marketing... (and you can view some of them in the 'related posts' at the bottom)

...and the reason is that, for the last 14 months or so, I've been studying towards a [Diploma in Professional Marketing](http://www.cim.co.uk/qualifications/diploma-in-professional-marketing/) from the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM).

The course - that I took with the help and facilitation of the [Oxford College of Marketing](http://www.oxfordcollegeofmarketing.com/) - involved me heading to three hour long evening classes in Brighton for a number of Tuesdays after work.

These were exceptionally long days, and normally meant I wasn't totally __compos mentis__ on a number of the following Wednesday mornings!

The diploma is made up of three modules:

- *Mastering Metrics - *where you gain an understanding of key marketing metrics and measurement techniques that help you identify and interpret insights to support informed strategic decisions.
- *Digital Strategy -  *a module that helps you to provide insight into how organisations can implement a digital marketing strategy and build these capabilities into the overall strategic plan.
- *Strategic Marketing* - learning about the strategic marketing planning process, including how to evaluate and implement it through effective management of resources.


The process for the first two modules involved writing lengthy assignments based on an organisation of your choice, and both came in at around the 8,000 word mark.

For someone that didn't actually have to do a written dissertation for their degree ([I had a go at making TV news packages instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlO3Twvl9es)) it was a bit of a slog, and involved a couple of weekends coming into Tomango HQ so I could get it all done in time.

And the third module - the Strategic Marketing one - culminated in a *three hour long exam*. A handwritten exam. On the hottest day of the year. In a room where the bloody windows wouldn't open. Absolute nightmare!

Anyway, I was pretty chuffed to find out last Thursday that I had in fact passed my final two modules - including nailing a distinction in the horrible exam - and after tallying up achieved an overall Merit grade!

Studying the CIM Diploma has definitely helped me in a professional marketing capacity and I'd definitely recommend considering studying it if you're looking to take on an account management role in either a general marketing or digitally focused profession.

If anyone has any suggestions for my next challenge, please get in touch!
