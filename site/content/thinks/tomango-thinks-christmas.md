Jingle jingle merrily on the manger, Santa Claus is coming to Bethlehem and the three wise snowmen are riding a sleigh pulled by Rudolph the red nosed Jesus! Merry Christmas!!!

Everyone has a different take on Christmas - I asked the Tomango team what their bests and worsts were about the festive season. Find out their answers below...

## Favourite Christmas Song?

The Tomango Spotify playlist's been filled with Christmas cheer since the 1st (including the Christmas Macarena - who knew?)...but what's everyone's highlight?

Nikki: "[Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas is You.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQViqx6GMY)"

Mark: "'[Driving Home for Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THcbQyFtCqg).' "

Mike: "'[Christmas Lights' by Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1rYmzQ8C9Q)."

Trys: "It fluctuates between '[Merry Christmas Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeyHl1tQeaQ)', '[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ6yQgBvuoI)', and '[Driving Home for Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THcbQyFtCqg)'."

Tom: "I've always been partial to Harry Belafonte's version of '[Mary's Boy Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY3o4_iIudg)'. And, on the other end of the spectrum, '[Christmas in Hollis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR07r0ZMFb8)' by Run DMC!"

## Favourite Christmas Film?

There's an even split here among the ranks.

Tom: "Home Alone."

Mike: "Home Alone. It sums up Christmas for me - a bit of violence, robbery, and kids."

Steve: "It's a Wonderful Life."

Trys: "It's a Wonderful Life."

Nikki: "Home Alone."

Mark: "It's a Wonderful Life."

__And, just to make everyone feel old...did you know that Macauley Culkin is now the same age his mother was when Home Alone was filmed?__

## Best thing about Christmas?

Mark: "Brandy butter."

Tom: "Lies ins and sustained indulgence of food and drink."

Steve: "Family and friends all getting together."

Trys: "Pretty much everything to be honest but spending time with family is near the top of the list. Summed up beautifully by Judy Garland: "Happy golden days of yore. Faithful friends who are dear to us gather near to us once more." "

Mike: "Spending quality time with my kids!"

Nikki: "All the food!"

## When should the ‘Christmas period’ begin?

Steve: "December."

Nikki: "1st of December.

Mark: "Second week of December."

Tom: "A week to ten days before."

Mike: "The 19th of December."

Trys: "Given I start listening to Christmas songs in June/July, sometime around then? Maybe September at a push."

## Least favourite thing about Christmas?

Nikki: "The feeling you get when you’ve eaten all the food!"

Steve: "Consumerism and the John Lewis Christmas advert!"

Tom: "Stepping on the scales afterwards."

Mark: "Bingeing for 2 days​ and then having nothing to do for the rest of the time - why not spread it out, people?"

Mike: "Candied peel."

Trys: "That final Sunday afternoon before going back to work. I swear it always rains on that day..."

## Favourite Christmas TV special?

Steve: "Morecambe and Wise."

Nikki: "Morecambe and Wise, of course."

Mike: "The Only Fools and Horses Christmas specials."

__Fun fact - the episode where Del and Rodney became millionaires is the most viewed episode of a comedy ever in the UK!__

Trys: "Although not a Christmas special, I for one can't wait for the new series of Sherlock airing over Christmas."

Tom: "Definitely the Gavin and Stacey one."

Mark: "Don't really watch much TV over Christmas, but always used to like The Royle Family or going further back, Only Fools &amp; Horses"

## 


## Worst Christmas present you’ve ever received?

Mark: "A Manchester United headband/sweatband combo someone gave me in the late 80s. I'm an Everton fan.​"

Tom: "Every bodywash gift set ever."

Steve: "A toaster - I was holding out for a TV!"

Mike: "A bar of soap..."

Nikki: "An electric blue towelling jumper thing...nice."

Trys: "Satsumas, can't be dealing with them."

## Favourite Christmas drink?

Nikki: "Champagne."

Mike: "Sloe gin."

Steve: "Mulled wine or a good dark beer."

Tom: "Anything within reach!"

Mark: "Champagne. Such expensive tastes..."

Trys: "Mulled wine."

## What is your one Christmas wish?

Mark: "For everyone to stop being so grumpy with one another (Brexit, Trump etc)"

Steve - "Peace on Earth."

Mike: "My Christmas wish would have to be that the Monopoly board stays in the cupboard!"

</div>
Nikki: "That no-one's ill at Christmas..."

Trys: "That we'll all wake up and realise 2016 was just a bad dream. Or I get a drone, that could work too."

Tom: "That my undefeated Monopoly run that stretches back to 2012 remains intact (though I won't ask Mike if he wants a game!)"

Merry Christmas from all at Tomango!
