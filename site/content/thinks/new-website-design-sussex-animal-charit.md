Today we revisit the launch of the new Raystede animal welfare charity website.

Back in 2011, we were commissioned to undertake a complete [website design](/creates/web/) and development for Raystede, a Sussex-based animal welfare charity.  In June of that year the website design was signed off, and here we revisit that key stage of the project, which was completed later that year.

## The final design

The final design for the website was approved with only one or two tweaks required by the client. The process went smoothly thanks to the time we invested earlier in preparing wireframes showing the layout of pages.

Here you can compare the two. Above you can see the wireframe and below is the final design.  You can no doubt see how working so hard on the wireframes made the step to the full design a much shorter one.

## What happens next

Now it’s full speed ahead for our programmer who is building the functioning website as I write.

Copywriting is under way and soon we will be given access to the content management system to begin uploading the words in to the sections that have been completed.

There is still a fair bit of programming to be done on the more complex parts such as the shop, the events diary and booking system, but the general information pages will be accessible to us while that goes on.

By having a cross-over period like this, where content can be entered  by us in one part of the site whilst programming continues on another, makes the most of the time we have available and helps us to deliver the final website to the client sooner.

## Getting the copy right

Raystede puts all its efforts into giving animals a better life and the Sussex charity wants to give the animals a voice on its website pages.

Our copywriter’s brief is to prepare content as if written by the animals and we're all looking forward to seeing the end result.

Writing copy for your website is never as easy as it sounds.  If you're having difficulty completing your website design project because of writers block, *Tomango* can provide [copywriting](/creates/online-marketing/content-creation-copywriting/) as part of our service; give us a call to find out how we can help.

## Getting the right fit for the client

It's important for us to understand at the outset the ‘feel’ a client is aiming for in their website. We ask about the tone of voice they would like portrayed.

Some people want their sites to be warm, friendly and personal but that doesn’t work for everyone. In other cases it is more appropriate to present a more corporate look.  It is never One Size Fits All...

We seek to understand the key message our clients are trying to get across about their organisation or business, and the one piece of advice we offer to each of them is to put themselves into the shoes of their website visitors. What will the visitors be looking for, what will they want to see?

## Find out more about the Raystede project

In 2011, we blogged (as Blue Planet) extensively about our progress on the Raystede website because it encompasses, in one place, many of the elements we get asked for by other clients for their sites.

There is a database of animals needing to be re-homed, an on-line shop, an events calendar, a booking system, an education area for teachers and children and a section for sponsorship and donations.
