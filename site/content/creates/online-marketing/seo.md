**Organic SEO remains one of the key pillars of digital marketing. Our expertise will help your business get found by the right people.**

Our tailor-made campaigns will get your website higher up the rankings for the search terms your target customers use.

We don’t try and cheat the system; we understand what Google wants and play by the rules. We won’t jeopardise your long-term online profile by using underhand tactics.

## SEO Audit
Before we get started we’ll carry out a comprehensive SEO audit of your website, looking for anything that needs fixing or that might provide quick wins before we move onto the really in-depth work.

Then we’ll develop your SEO strategy that’ll help increase your online search presence.

## Keyword Research
Understanding what your target customers search for is key to your SEO strategy.

We’ll take an in-depth look at your current search rankings and conduct competitor analysis to provide a robust list of keywords that Tomango will aim to improve your site’s position for.

Then we’ll create great content, fully optimised for search, that targets these keywords.

## Technical SEO Factors
Working alongside our website design team we’ll fine-tune your site to improve its technical performance where needed. This might include optimising your website meta-data, improving the load speed, or amending your website’s structure.

## Offsite SEO
We’ll recommend other ways of improving your website’s authority through links or PR opportunities that in turn have a positive effect on search presence.

As a full-service marketing agency, we leave no stone unturned – we take a holistic approach to your SEO and consider all aspects of your digital marketing mix to get you the best results.
