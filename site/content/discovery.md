If you went to a doctor, a lawyer, or any other expert, you wouldn’t tell them what they should do to help you, would you?

Of course you wouldn’t.

You’d expect them to diagnose or consider your problem and recommend the best course of action.

We do exactly the same thing with your project. 

We don’t write proposals and we won’t take part in a competitive pitching process. Both of these ways of buying are flawed, because we don’t have anywhere near enough information to make the best recommendations to you.

Instead, we take the time to find out what it is you’re trying to achieve as a business, what the issues are, and how to get you from here to there as quickly as possible.

We do this through a **Discovery Session**.

## How the session works

In Part 1, we find out as much as we can about your goals. We ask lots of questions and get you thinking about your business in ways you might not have considered. This needs to involve all the key decision-makers in your business and is run as a half-day workshop.

In Part 2, we take away what we've learnt in the workshop and, as a team, have a second session at Tomango HQ. We explore what’s needed to get you from where you are now to where you want to be. 

In Part 3, we present our recommendations. We'll talk you through three costed options so you can decide which one you’d like to go ahead with.
